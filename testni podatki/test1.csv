"Inspector Lestrade, James Moriarty, Mrs. Hudson (Conan Doyle series), Irene Adler, Mycroft Holmes, Dr. John Watson, Sherlock Holmes","English",,"Audie Award","The Complete Sherlock Holmes","Sherlock Holmes","Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle was born the third of ten siblings on 22 May 1859 in Edinburgh, Scotland. His father, <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/345352.Charles_Altamont_Doyle"" title=""Charles Altamont Doyle"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Charles Altamont Doyle</a>, a talented illustrator, was born in England of Irish descent, and his mother, born Mary Foley, was Irish. They were married in 1855.<br /><br />Although he is now referred to as ""Conan Doyle"", the origin of this compound surname (if that is how he meant it to be understood) is uncertain. His baptism record in the registry of St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh gives 'Arthur Ignatius Conan' as his Christian name, and simply 'Doyle' as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his godfather.<br /><br />At the age of nine Conan Doyle was sent to the Roman Catholic Jesuit preparatory school, Hodder Place, Stonyhurst. He then went on to Stonyhurst College, leaving in 1875.<br /><br />From 1876 to 1881 he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh. This required that he provide periodic medical assistance in the towns of Aston (now a district of Birmingham) and Sheffield. While studying, Conan Doyle began writing short stories. His first published story appeared in ""<i>Chambers's Edinburgh Journal</i>"" before he was 20. Following his graduation, he was employed as a ship's doctor on the SS Mayumba during a voyage to the West African coast. He completed his doctorate on the subject of tabes dorsalis in 1885.<br /><br />In 1885 Conan Doyle married Louisa (or Louise) Hawkins, known as ""Touie"". She suffered from tuberculosis and died on 4 July 1906. The following year he married Jean Elizabeth Leckie, whom he had first met and fallen in love with in 1897. Due to his sense of loyalty he had maintained a purely platonic relationship with Jean while his first wife was alive. Jean died in London on 27 June 1940.<br /><br />Conan Doyle fathered five children. Two with his first wife—Mary Louise (28 January 1889 – 12 June 1976), and Arthur Alleyne Kingsley, known as Kingsley (15 November 1892 – 28 October 1918). With his second wife he had three children—Denis Percy Stewart (17 March 1909 – 9 March 1955), second husband in 1936 of Georgian Princess Nina Mdivani (circa 1910 – 19 February 1987; former sister-in-law of Barbara Hutton); Adrian Malcolm (19 November 1910–3 June 1970) and Jean Lena Annette (21 December 1912–18 November 1997).<br /><br />Conan Doyle was found clutching his chest in the hall of Windlesham, his house in Crowborough, East Sussex, on 7 July 1930. He had died of a heart attack at age 71. His last words were directed toward his wife: ""You are wonderful."" The epitaph on his gravestone in the churchyard at Minstead in the New Forest, Hampshire, reads:<br /><br />STEEL TRUE<br />BLADE STRAIGHT<br />ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE<br />KNIGHT<br />PATRIOT, PHYSICIAN &amp; MAN OF LETTERS<br /><br />Conan Doyle's house, Undershaw, located in Hindhead, south of London, where he had lived for a decade, had been a hotel and restaurant between 1924 and 2004. It now stands empty while conservationists and Conan Doyle fans fight to preserve it.<br /><br />A statue honours Conan Doyle at Crowborough Cross in Crowborough, where Conan Doyle lived for 23 years. There is also a statue of Sherlock Holmes in Picardy Place, Edinburgh, close to the house where Conan Doyle was born.<br /><br /><b>Series:</b><br />* <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/series/49996-sherlock-holmes"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Sherlock Holmes</a>","Arthur Conan Doyle","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2448.Arthur_Conan_Doyle","Paperback","188572","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B097QDST79/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553328255/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0553328255&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/The+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Ftn%3DThe+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3DThe+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=The+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3DThe+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=The+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FThe+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3DThe+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes","https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=The+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:The+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=The+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes",,"A study in scarlet --<br /><br />The sign of four --<br /><br />Adventures of Sherlock Holmes : A scandal in Bohemia ; The red-headed league ; A case of identity ; The Boscombe Valley mystery ; The five orange pips ; The man with the twisted lip ; The adventure of the blue carbuncle ; The adventure of the speckled band ; The adventure of the engineer's thumb ; The adventure of the noble bachelor ; The adventure of the beryl coronet ; The adventure of the copper beeches --<br /><br />Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes : Silver blaze ; The yellow face ; The stock-broker's clerk ; The ""Gloria Scott"" ; The Musgrave ritual ; The Reigate puzzle ; The crooked man ; The resident patient ; The Greek interpreter ; The naval treaty ; The final problem --<br /><br />The return of Sherlock Holmes : The adventure of the empty house ; The adventure of the Norwood builder ; The adventure of the dancing men ; The adventure of the solitary cyclist ; The adventure of the priory school ; The adventure of Black Peter ; The adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton ; The adventure of the six Napoleons ; The adventure of the three students ; The adventure of the golden pince-nez ; The adventure of the missing three-quarter ; The adventure of the abbey grange ; The adventure of the second stain. <br /><br />Volume 2.

Garcí­a Márquez, familiarly known as ""Gabo"" in his native country, was considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century. In 1982, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.<br /><br />He studied at the University of Bogotá and later worked as a reporter for the Colombian newspaper <i>El Espectador</i> and as a foreign correspondent in Rome, Paris, Barcelona, Caracas, and New York. He wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best-known for his novels, such as <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> (1967) and <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i> (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magical realism, which uses magical elements and events in order to explain real experiences. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo, and most of them express the theme of solitude.<br /><br />Having previously written shorter fiction and screenplays, García Márquez sequestered himself away in his Mexico City home for an extended period of time to complete his novel <i>Cien años de soledad</i>, or <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>, published in 1967. The author drew international acclaim for the work, which ultimately sold tens of millions of copies worldwide. García Márquez is credited with helping introduce an array of readers to magical realism, a genre that combines more conventional storytelling forms with vivid, layers of fantasy.<br /><br />Another one of his novels, <i>El amor en los tiempos del cólera</i> (1985), or <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i>, drew a large global audience as well. The work was partially based on his parents' courtship and was adapted into a 2007 film starring Javier Bardem. García Márquez wrote seven novels during his life, with additional titles that include <i>El general en su laberinto</i> (1989), or <i>The General in His Labyrinth</i>, and <i>Del amor y otros demonios</i> (1994), or <i>Of Love and Other Demons</i>.<br /><br />(Arabic: <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5029628._"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">جابرييل جارسيا ماركيز</a>) (Hebrew: <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7091051._"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">גבריאל גארסיה מרקס</a>) (Ukrainian: <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14544328.______________________"" title=""Ґабріель Ґарсія Маркес"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Ґабріель Ґарсія Маркес</a>) (Belarussian: <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/43500299.______________________"" title=""Габрыель Гарсія Маркес"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Габрыель Гарсія Маркес</a>) (Russian: <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8327668.______________________"" title=""Габриэль Гарсия Маркес"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Габриэль Гарсия Маркес</a>)","Gabriel García Márquez","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13450.Gabriel_Garc_a_M_rquez","Paperback","9712","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NKDOZNM/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140003468X/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=140003468X&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Love+in+the+Time+of+Cholera&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9781400034680","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D140003468X","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9781400034680","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9781400034680?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781400034680&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D140003468X","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9781400034680","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FLove+in+the+Time+of+Cholera-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D140003468X","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781400034680","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:140003468X/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=140003468X","In their youth, Florentino Ariza and Fermina Daza fall passionately in love.

She was raised in rural Kentucky and lived briefly in Africa in her early childhood. Kingsolver earned degrees in Biology at DePauw University and the University of Arizona and worked as a freelance writer before she began writing novels. Her most famous works include <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i>, the tale of a missionary family in the Congo, and <i>Animal, Vegetable, Miracle</i>, a non-fiction account of her family's attempts to eat locally.<br /><br />Her work often focuses on topics such as social justice, biodiversity, and the interaction between humans and their communities and environments. Each of her books published since 1993 have been on <i>The New York Times</i> Best Seller list. Kingsolver has received numerous awards, including the UK's Orange Prize for Fiction 2010, for <i>The Lacuna</i> and the National Humanities Medal. She has been nominated for the PEN/Faulkner Award and the Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />In 2000, Kingsolver established the Bellwether Prize to support ""literature of social change.""<br /><br />Kingsolver was born in Annapolis, Maryland in 1955 and grew up in Carlisle in rural Kentucky. When Kingsolver was seven years old, her father, a physician, took the family to the former Republic of Congo in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Her parents worked in a public health capacity, and the family lived without electricity or running water.<br /><br />After graduating from high school, Kingsolver attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana on a music scholarship, studying classical piano. Eventually, however, she changed her major to biology when she realized that ""classical pianists compete for six job openings a year, and the rest of [them:] get to play 'Blue Moon' in a hotel lobby."" She was involved in activism on her campus, and took part in protests against the Vietnam war. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1977, and moved to France for a year before settling in Tucson, Arizona, where she would live for much of the next two decades. In 1980 she enrolled in graduate school at the University of Arizona, where she earned a Master's degree in ecology and evolutionary biology.<br /><br />Kingsolver began her full-time writing career in the mid 1980s as a science writer for the university, which eventually lead to some freelance feature writing. She began her career in fiction writing after winning a short story contest in a local Phoenix newspaper. In 1985 she married Joseph Hoffmann; their daughter Camille was born in 1987. She moved with her daughter to Tenerife in the Canary Islands for a year during the first Gulf war, mostly due to frustration over America's military involvement. After returning to the US in 1992, she separated from her husband.<br /><br />In 1994, Kingsolver was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from her alma mater, DePauw University. She was also married to Steven Hopp, that year, and their daughter, Lily, was born in 1996. In 2004, Kingsolver moved with her family to a farm in Washington County, Virginia, where they currently reside. In 2008, she received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Duke University, where she delivered a commencement address entitled ""How to be Hopeful"".<br /><br />In a 2010 interview with The Guardian, Kingsolver says, ""I never wanted to be famous, and still don't, [...:] the universe rewarded me with what I dreaded most."" She says created her own website just to compete with a plethora of fake ones, ""as a defence to protect my family from misinformation. Wikipedia abhors a vacuum.

</i> (1925), concern troubled individuals in a nightmarishly impersonal world.<br /><br />Jewish middle-class family of this major fiction writer of the 20th century spoke German. People consider his unique body of much incomplete writing, mainly published posthumously, among the most influential in European literature. <br /><br />His stories include ""The Metamorphosis"" (1912) and ""<i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/581552.In_the_Penal_Colony"" title=""In the Penal Colony"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">In the Penal Colony</a>

</i> (1926) and <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22911.Amerika"" title=""Amerika"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Amerika</a>
</i> (1927).<br /><br />Despite first language, Kafka also spoke fluent Czech. Later, Kafka acquired some knowledge of the French language and culture from <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1461.Flaubert"" title=""Flaubert"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Flaubert</a>, one of his favorite authors. <br /><br />Kafka first studied chemistry at the Charles-Ferdinand University of Prague but after two weeks switched to law. This study offered a range of career possibilities, which pleased his father, and required a longer course of study that gave Kafka time to take classes in German studies and art history. At the university, he joined a student club, named Lese- und Redehalle der Deutschen Studenten, which organized literary events, readings, and other activities. In the end of his first year of studies, he met <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13004.Max_Brod"" title=""Max Brod"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Max Brod</a>, a close friend of his throughout his life, together with the journalist <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1946467.Felix_Weltsch"" title=""Felix Weltsch"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Felix Weltsch</a>, who also studied law. Kafka obtained the degree of doctor of law on 18 June 1906 and performed an obligatory year of unpaid service as law clerk for the civil and criminal courts. <br /><br />Writing of Kafka attracted little attention before his death. During his lifetime, he published only a few short stories and never finished any of his novels except the very short ""<i>The Metamorphosis</i>."" Kafka wrote to Max Brod, his friend and literary executor: ""Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me ... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread."" Brod told Kafka that he intended not to honor these wishes, but Kafka, so knowing, nevertheless consequently gave these directions specifically to Brod, who, so reasoning, overrode these wishes. Brod in fact oversaw the publication of most of work of Kafka in his possession; these works quickly began to attract attention and high critical regard. <br /><br />Max Brod encountered significant difficulty in compiling notebooks of Kafka into any chronological order as Kafka started writing in the middle of notebooks, from the last towards the first, et cetera.<br /><br />Kafka wrote all his published works in German except several letters in Czech to Milena Jesenská.

He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely.

It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing—though absurdly comic—meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, <i>The Metamorphosis</i> has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction.

When the Bolsheviks requisitioned the pharmacy that Fronz Rosenbaum, her father, owned, the family fled to the Crimea. Alisa returned to the city, renamed Leningrad, to attend the university, but relatives already settled in America and in 1926 offered her the chance of joining them. With money from the sale of jewelry of her mother, Alisa bought a ticket to New York. On arrival at Ellis Island, she changed into Ayn (after a name of some Finnish author, probably ""Aino"") Rand (a supposed abbreviation of her Russian surname).

At least 20 films and TV dramas have been produced from Capote novels, stories and screenplays.<br /><br />He was born as Truman Streckfus Persons to a salesman Archulus Persons and young Lillie Mae. His parents divorced when he was four and he went to live with his mother's relatives in Monroeville, Alabama. He was a lonely child who learned to read and write by himself before entering school. In 1933, he moved to New York City to live with his mother and her new husband, Joseph Capote, a Cuban-born businessman. Mr. Capote adopted Truman, legally changing his last name to Capote and enrolling him in private school. After graduating from high school in 1942, Truman Capote began his regular job as a copy boy at <i>The New Yorker</i>. During this time, he also began his career as a writer, publishing many short stories which introduced him into a circle of literary critics. His first novel, <i>Other Voices, Other Rooms</i>, published in 1948, stayed on The New York Times bestseller list for nine weeks and became controversial because of the photograph of Capote used to promote the novel, posing seductively and gazing into the camera.<br /><br />In the 1950s and 1960s, Capote remained prolific producing both fiction and non-fiction. His masterpiece, <i>In Cold Blood</i>, a story about the murder of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas, was published in 1966 in book form by Random House, became a worldwide success and brought Capote much praise from the literary community. After this success he published rarely and suffered from alcohol addiction.

Before dedicating his life completely to literature, he worked as theatre director and actor, lyricist and journalist. In 1986, PAULO COELHO did the pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostella, an experience later to be documented in his book The Pilgrimage. In the following year, COELHO published The Alchemist. Slow initial sales convinced his first publisher to drop the novel, but it went on to become one of the best selling Brazilian books of all time. Other titles include Brida (1990), The Valkyries (1992), By the river Piedra I sat Down and Wept (1994), the collection of his best columns published in the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo entitle Maktub (1994), the compilation of texts Phrases (1995), The Fifth Mountain (1996), Manual of a Warrior of Light (1997), Veronika decides to die (1998), The Devil and Miss Prym (2000), the compilation of traditional tales in Stories for parents, children and grandchildren (2001), Eleven Minutes (2003), The Zahir (2005), The Witch of Portobello (2006) and Winner Stands Alone (to be released in 2009). During the months of March, April, May and June 2006, Paulo Coelho traveled to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostella in 1986. He also held surprise book signings - announced one day in advance - in some cities along the way, to have a chance to meet his readers. In ninety days of pilgrimage the author traveled around the globe and took the famous Transiberrian train that took him to Vladivostok. During this experience Paulo Coelho launched his blog Walking the Path - The Pilgrimage in order to share with his readers his impressions. Since this first blog Paulo Coelho has expanded his presence in the internet with his daily blogs in Wordpress, Myspace &amp; Facebook. He is equally present in media sharing sites such as Youtube and Flickr, offering on a regular basis not only texts but also videos and pictures to his readers.

Known to millions around the world as the author of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, Tolkien spent most of his life teaching at the University of Oxford where he was a distinguished academic in the fields of Old and Middle English and Old Norse. His creativity, confined to his spare time, found its outlet in fantasy works, stories for children, poetry, illustration and invented languages and alphabets.<br /><br />Tolkien’s most popular works, <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> are set in Middle-earth, an imagined world with strangely familiar settings inhabited by ancient and extraordinary peoples. Through this secondary world Tolkien writes perceptively of universal human concerns – love and loss, courage and betrayal, humility and pride – giving his books a wide and enduring appeal.<br /><br />Tolkien was an accomplished amateur artist who painted for pleasure and relaxation. He excelled at landscapes and often drew inspiration from his own stories. He illustrated many scenes from <i>The Silmarillion</i>, <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, sometimes drawing or painting as he was writing in order to visualize the imagined scene more clearly.<br /><br />Tolkien was a professor at the Universities of Leeds and Oxford for almost forty years, teaching Old and Middle English, as well as Old Norse and Gothic. His illuminating lectures on works such as the Old English epic poem, <i>Beowulf</i>, illustrate his deep knowledge of ancient languages and at the same time provide new insights into peoples and legends from a remote past.<br /><br />Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa, in 1892 to English parents. He came to England aged three and was brought up in and around Birmingham. He graduated from the University of Oxford in 1915 and saw active service in France during the First World War before being invalided home. After the war he pursued an academic career teaching Old and Middle English. Alongside his professional work, he invented his own languages and began to create what he called a mythology for England; it was this ‘legendarium’ that he would work on throughout his life. But his literary work did not start and end with Middle-earth, he also wrote poetry, children’s stories and fairy tales for adults. He died in 1973 and is buried in Oxford where he spent most of his adult life.","J.R.R.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.<br /><br />But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.","January 15, 1985","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408303130i/375802.jpg","324","1333072","48417","Tor","September 30, 2004","4.31","Ender’s Game","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game"

</i> (1952), which concern courageous, lonely characters, and he won the Nobel Prize of 1954 for literature.<br /><br />Economical and understated style of Hemingway strongly influenced 20th-century fiction, whereas his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s. He published seven novels, six short story collections and two nonfiction works. Survivors published posthumously three novels, four collections of short stories, and three nonfiction works. People consider many of these classics. <br /><br />After high school, Hemingway reported for a few months for the Kansas City <i>Star</i> before leaving for the Italian front to enlist. In 1918, someone seriously wounded him, who returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10799.A_Farewell_to_Arms"" title=""A Farewell to Arms"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">A Farewell to Arms</a>
</i>. In 1922, he married Hadley Richardson, the first of his four wives. The couple moved, and he worked as a foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the expatriate community of the ""lost generation"" of 1920s. <br /><br />After his divorce of 1927 from Hadley Richardson, Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer. At the Spanish civil war, he acted as a journalist; afterward, they divorced, and he wrote <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46170.For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls"" title=""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a>
</i>. Hemingway maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida, and Cuba during the 1930s and 1940s. <br /><br />Martha Gellhorn served as third wife of Hemingway in 1940. When he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II, they separated; he presently witnessed at the Normandy landings and liberation of Paris.<br /><br />Shortly after 1952, Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where two plane crashes almost killed him and left him in pain and ill health for much of the rest of his life. Nevertheless, in 1959, he moved from Cuba to Ketchum, Idaho, where he committed suicide in the summer of 1961.

Her works reflect her strong interest in modern science: tesseracts, for example, are featured prominently in <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>, mitochondrial DNA in <i>A Wind in the Door</i>, organ regeneration in <i>The Arm of the Starfish</i>, and so forth.<br /><br />""Madeleine was born on November 29th, 1918, and spent her formative years in New York City. Instead of her school work, she found that she would much rather be writing stories, poems and journals for herself, which was reflected in her grades (not the best). However, she was not discouraged.<br /><br />At age 12, she moved to the French Alps with her parents and went to an English boarding school where, thankfully, her passion for writing continued to grow. She flourished during her high school years back in the United States at Ashley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina, vacationing with her mother in a rambling old beach cottage on a beautiful stretch of Florida beach.<br /><br />She went to Smith College and studied English with some wonderful teachers as she read the classics and continued her own creative writing. She graduated with honors and moved into a Greenwich Village apartment in New York. She worked in the theater, where Equity union pay and a flexible schedule afforded her the time to write! She published her first two novels during these years—<i>A Small Rain</i> and <i>Ilsa</i>—before meeting Hugh Franklin, her future husband, when she was an understudy in Anton Chekov's <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>. They married during <i>The Joyous Season</i>.<br /><br />She had a baby girl and kept on writing, eventually moving to Connecticut to raise the family away from the city in a small dairy farm village with more cows than people. They bought a dead general store, and brought it to life for 9 years. They moved back to the city with three children, and Hugh revitalized his professional acting career. The family has kept the country house, Crosswicks, and continues to spend summers there.<br /><br />As the years passed and the children grew, Madeleine continued to write and Hugh to act, and they to enjoy each other and life. Madeleine began her association with the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, where she has been the librarian and maintained an office for more than thirty years. After Hugh's death in 1986, it was her writing and lecturing that kept her going. She has now lived through the 20th century and into the 21st and has written over 60 books and keeps writing. She enjoys being with her friends, her children, her grandchildren, and her great grandchildren.""<br /><br /><a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""http://us.macmillan.com/author/madeleinelengle"">http://us.macmillan.com/author/madele...</a><br /><br />Copyright © 2007 Crosswicks, Ltd.

Rowling</b>, pronounced like <i>rolling</i>, her name when her first <i>Harry Potter</i> book was published was simply <b>Joanne Rowling</b>. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose <b>K</b> as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls herself <b>Jo</b> and has said, ""No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was young, unless they were angry."" Following her marriage, she has sometimes used the name <b>Joanne Murray</b> when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of <b>Joanne Kathleen Rowling</b>. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.<br /><br />Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather, Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War.<br /><br />Rowling's sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four. She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the <i>Harry Potter</i> headmaster Albus Dumbledore.<br /><br />As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: ""I can still remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee."" At the age of nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her great aunt, who Rowling said ""taught classics and approved of a thirst for knowledge, even of a questionable kind,"" gave her a very old copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, <i>Hons and Rebels</i>. Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.<br /><br />Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New Yorker, ""I wasn’t particularly happy. I think it’s a dreadful time of life."" She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science department. Rowling said of her adolescence, ""Hermione [a bookish, know-it-all <i>Harry Potter</i> character] is loosely based on me. She's a caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud of."" Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived, remembers her as ""not exceptional"" but ""one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English."" Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says inspired the one in her books.","J.K.

In many ways her life resembles a fairy tale. Born into a family with a rich artistic and historical background, her paternal grandfather was author and Punch cartoonist <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/113849.George_du_Maurier"" title=""George du Maurier"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">George du Maurier</a>, who created the character of Svengali in the 1894 novel Trilby, and her mother was a maternal niece of journalist, author, and lecturer <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/910910.Comyns_Beaumont"" title=""Comyns Beaumont"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Comyns Beaumont</a>. She and her sisters were indulged as a children and grew up enjoying enormous freedom from financial and parental restraint. Her elder sister, <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/780085.Angela_du_Maurier"" title=""Angela du Maurier"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Angela du Maurier</a>, also became a writer, and her younger sister Jeanne was a painter.<br /><br />She spent her youth sailing boats, travelling on the Continent with friends, and writing stories. Her family connections helped her establish her literary career, and she published some of her early work in Beaumont's Bystander magazine. A prestigious publishing house accepted her first novel when she was in her early twenties, and its publication brought her not only fame but the attentions of a handsome soldier, Major (later Lieutenant-General Sir) Frederick Browning, whom she married.<br /><br />She continued writing under her maiden name, and her subsequent novels became bestsellers, earning her enormous wealth and fame. Many have been successfully adapted into films, including the novels Rebecca, Frenchman's Creek, My Cousin Rachel, and Jamaica Inn, and the short stories The Birds and Don't Look Now/Not After Midnight. While Alfred Hitchcock's films based upon her novels proceeded to make her one of the best-known authors in the world, she enjoyed the life of a fairy princess in a mansion in Cornwall called Menabilly, which served as the model for Manderley in Rebecca.<br /><br />Daphne du Maurier was obsessed with the past. She intensively researched the lives of Francis and Anthony Bacon, the history of Cornwall, the Regency period, and nineteenth-century France and England. Above all, however, she was obsessed with her own family history, which she chronicled in Gerald: A Portrait, a biography of her father; The du Mauriers, a study of her family which focused on her grandfather, George du Maurier, the novelist and illustrator for Punch; The Glassblowers, a novel based upon the lives of her du Maurier ancestors; and Growing Pains, an autobiography that ignores nearly 50 years of her life in favour of the joyful and more romantic period of her youth. Daphne du Maurier can best be understood in terms of her remarkable and paradoxical family, the ghosts which haunted her life and fiction.<br /><br />While contemporary writers were dealing critically with such subjects as the war, alienation, religion, poverty, Marxism, psychology and art, and experimenting with new techniques such as the stream of consciousness, du Maurier produced 'old-fashioned' novels with straightforward narratives that appealed to a popular audience's love of fantasy, adventure, sexuality and mystery. At an early age, she recognised that her readership was comprised principally of women, and she cultivated their loyal following through several decades by embodying their desires and dreams in her novels and short stories.<br /><br />In some of her novels, however, she went beyond the technique of the formulaic romance to achieve a powerful psychological realism reflecting her intense feelings about her father, and to a lesser degree, her mother. This vision, which underlies Julius, Rebecca and The Parasites, is that of an author overwhelmed by the memory of her father's commanding presence. In Julius and The Parasites, for example, she introduces the image of a domineering but deadly father and the daring subject of incest.<br /><br />In Rebecca, on the other hand, du Maurier fuses psychological realism with a sophisticated version of the Cinderella story.

"Lorax, Swomee-Swans, Brown Bar-ba-loots, Humming-Fishes","English","0679889108","California Young Readers Medal","The Lorax",,"<b>Theodor Seuss Geisel</b> was born 2 March 1904 in Springfield, Massachusetts. He graduated Dartmouth College in 1925, and proceeded on to Oxford University with the intent of acquiring a doctorate in literature. At Oxford he met Helen Palmer, who he wed in 1927. He returned from Europe in 1927, and began working for a magazine called Judge, the leading humor magazine in America at the time, submitting both cartoons and humorous articles for them. Additionally, he was submitting cartoons to Life, Vanity Fair and Liberty. In some of his works, he'd made reference to an insecticide called Flit. These references gained notice, and led to a contract to draw comic ads for Flit. This association lasted 17 years, gained him national exposure, and coined the catchphrase ""Quick, Henry, the Flit!"" <br /><br />In 1936 on the way to a vacation in Europe, listening to the rhythm of the ship's engines, he came up with And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, which was then promptly rejected by the first 43 publishers he showed it to. Eventually in 1937 a friend published the book for him, and it went on to at least moderate success. <br /><br />During World War II, Geisel joined the army and was sent to Hollywood. Captain Geisel would write for Frank Capra's Signal Corps Unit (for which he won the Legion of Merit) and do documentaries (he won Oscar's for Hitler Lives and Design for Death). He also created a cartoon called Gerald McBoing-Boing which also won him an Oscar. <br /><br />In May of 1954, Life published a report concerning illiteracy among school children. The report said, among other things, that children were having trouble to read because their books were boring. This inspired Geisel's publisher, and prompted him to send Geisel a list of 400 words he felt were important, asked him to cut the list to 250 words (the publishers idea of how many words at one time a first grader could absorb), and write a book. Nine months later, Geisel, using 220 of the words given to him published <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233093.The_Cat_in_the_Hat"" title=""The Cat in the Hat"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The Cat in the Hat</a>
</i>, which went on to instant success. <br /><br />In 1960 Bennett Cerf bet Geisel $50 that he couldn't write an entire book using only fifty words. The result was <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23772.Green_Eggs_and_Ham"" title=""Green Eggs and Ham"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Green Eggs and Ham</a>
</i>. Cerf never paid the $50 from the bet. <br /><br />Helen Palmer Geisel died in 1967. Theodor Geisel married Audrey Stone Diamond in 1968. Theodor Seuss Geisel died 24 September 1991. <br /><br />Also worked under the pen name: <b>

S. Forester, was <i>Shot Down Over Libya</i>. Today the story is published as <i>A Piece of Cake</i>. The story, about his wartime adventures, was bought by the Saturday Evening Post for $900, and propelled him into a career as a writer. Its title was inspired by a highly inaccurate and sensationalized article about the crash that blinded him, which claimed he had been shot down instead of simply having to land because of low fuel.<br /><br />His first children's book was <i>The Gremlins</i>, about mischievous little creatures that were part of RAF folklore. The book was commissioned by Walt Disney for a film that was never made, and published in 1943. Dahl went on to create some of the best-loved children's stories of the 20th century, such as <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>, <i>Matilda</i> and <i>James and the Giant Peach</i>.<br /><br />He also had a successful parallel career as the writer of macabre adult short stories, usually with a dark sense of humour and a surprise ending. Many were originally written for American magazines such as <i>Ladies Home Journal</i>, <i>Harper's</i>, <i>Playboy</i> and <i>The New Yorker</i>, then subsequently collected by Dahl into anthologies, gaining world-wide acclaim. Dahl wrote more than 60 short stories and they have appeared in numerous collections, some only being published in book form after his death. His stories also brought him three Edgar Awards: in 1954, for the collection <i>Someone Like You</i>; in 1959, for the story ""The Landlady""; and in 1980, for the episode of <i>Tales of the Unexpected</i> based on ""Skin"".","Roald Dahl","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4273.Roald_Dahl","Paperback","6310","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093X805W/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142403881/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0142403881&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Charlie+and+the+Chocolate+Factory&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780142403884","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0142403881","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780142403884","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780142403884?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780142403884&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0142403881","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780142403884","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FCharlie+and+the+Chocolate+Factory-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0142403881","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780142403884","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0142403881/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0142403881","Charlie Bucket's wonderful adventure begins when he finds one of Mr. Willy Wonka's precious Golden Tickets and wins a whole day inside the mysterious chocolate factory.

It remains one of Ken’s most popular books.<br /><br />In 1989, Ken’s epic novel about the building of a medieval cathedral, The Pillars of the Earth, was published. It reached number one on best-seller lists everywhere and was turned into a major television series produced by Ridley Scott, which aired in 2010. World Without End, the sequel to The Pillars of the Earth, proved equally popular when it was published in 2007.<br /><br />Ken’s new book, The Evening and the Morning, will be published in September 2020. It is a prequel to The Pillars of the Earth and is set around the year 1,000, when Kingsbridge was an Anglo-Saxon settlement threatened by Viking invaders.<br /><br />Ken has been active in numerous literacy charities and was president of Dyslexia Action for ten years.

But what makes <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i> extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. <br /><br />Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.<br /><br />The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.<br /><br /><i>For the TV tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17229203-the-pillars-of-the-earth"">Alternate Cover Edition</a></i><br />","October 1, 1989","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100i/5043.jpg","976","742122","36339","NAL Trade","February 4, 2002","4.33","The Pillars of the Earth","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5043.The_Pillars_of_the_Earth"

A soc (short for ""social"") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc.

When the Bolsheviks requisitioned the pharmacy that Fronz Rosenbaum, her father, owned, the family fled to the Crimea. Alisa returned to the city, renamed Leningrad, to attend the university, but relatives already settled in America and in 1926 offered her the chance of joining them. With money from the sale of jewelry of her mother, Alisa bought a ticket to New York. On arrival at Ellis Island, she changed into Ayn (after a name of some Finnish author, probably ""Aino"") Rand (a supposed abbreviation of her Russian surname). She moved swiftly to Hollywood, where she learned English, worked in the RKO wardrobe department and as an extra, and wrote through the night on screenplays and novels. Because her original visa as a visitor expired, she also married a ""beautiful"" bit-part actor, called Frank O'Connor. <br /><br />Rand sold her first screenplay in 1932, but nobody bought <i>We the Living</i> (1936), her first novel and a melodrama, set in Russia. Her first real success was <i>The Fountainhead</i> (rejected by more than ten publishers before publication in 1943).<br /><br />She started a new philosophy, known as objectivism, opposed to state interference of all kinds, and her follow-up novel <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> (1957) describes a group who attempt to escape conspiracy of mediocrity of America. Objectivism has been an influence on various other movements such as Libertarianism, and Rand's vocal support for Laissez-faire Capitalism and the free market has earned her a distinct spot among American philosophers, and philosophers in general.<br />","Ayn Rand","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/432.Ayn_Rand","Mass Market Paperback","2122","http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&creative=374001&campaign=211041&adid=082VK13VJJCZTQYGWWCZ&index=books&keyword=The+Fountainhead","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Fountainhead&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/The+Fountainhead","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Ftn%3DThe+Fountainhead","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3DThe+Fountainhead","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=The+Fountainhead&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3DThe+Fountainhead","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=The+Fountainhead","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FThe+Fountainhead-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3DThe+Fountainhead","https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=The+Fountainhead","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:The+Fountainhead/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=The+Fountainhead",,,"The revolutionary literary vision that sowed the seeds of Objectivism, Ayn Rand's groundbreaking philosophy, and brought her immediate worldwide acclaim.<br /><br />This modern classic is the story of intransigent young architect Howard Roark, whose integrity was as unyielding as granite...of Dominique Francon, the exquisitely beautiful woman who loved Roark passionately, but married his worst enemy...and of the fanatic denunciation unleashed by an enraged society against a great creator.

</i> (1952), which concern courageous, lonely characters, and he won the Nobel Prize of 1954 for literature.<br /><br />Economical and understated style of Hemingway strongly influenced 20th-century fiction, whereas his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s. He published seven novels, six short story collections and two nonfiction works. Survivors published posthumously three novels, four collections of short stories, and three nonfiction works. People consider many of these classics. <br /><br />After high school, Hemingway reported for a few months for the Kansas City <i>Star</i> before leaving for the Italian front to enlist. In 1918, someone seriously wounded him, who returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel <i>

The couple moved, and he worked as a foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the expatriate community of the ""lost generation"" of 1920s. <br /><br />After his divorce of 1927 from Hadley Richardson, Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer. At the Spanish civil war, he acted as a journalist; afterward, they divorced, and he wrote <i>

When he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II, they separated; he presently witnessed at the Normandy landings and liberation of Paris.<br /><br />Shortly after 1952, Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where two plane crashes almost killed him and left him in pain and ill health for much of the rest of his life. Nevertheless, in 1959, he moved from Cuba to Ketchum, Idaho, where he committed suicide in the summer of 1961.

Keyes was given the Author Emeritus honor by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 2000.<br /><br />Keyes was born in Brooklyn, New York City, New York. At age 17, he joined the U.S. Maritime Service as ship's purser. He obtained a B.A. in psychology from Brooklyn College, and after a stint in fashion photography (partner in a photography studio), earned a Master's Degree in English and American Literature at night while teaching English in New York City public schools during the day and writing weekends.<br /><br />In the early 1950s, he was editor of the pulp magazine <i>Marvel Science Fiction</i> for publisher Martin Goodman. Circa 1952, Keyes was one of several staff writers, officially titled editors, who wrote for such horror and science fiction comics as <i>Journey into Unknown Worlds</i>, for which Keyes wrote two stories with artist Basil Wolverton. From 1955-56, Keyes wrote for the celebrated EC Comics, including its titles <i>Shock Illustrated</i> and <i>Confessions Illustrated</i>, under both his own name and the pseudonyms Kris Daniels, A.D. Locke and Dominik Georg.<br /><br />The short story and subsequent novel, <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>, is written as progress reports of a mentally disabled man, Charlie, who undergoes experimental surgery and briefly becomes a genius before the effects tragically wear off. The story was initially published in the April 1959 issue of <i>The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction</i> and the expanded novel in 1966. The novel has been adapted several times for other media, most prominently as the 1968 film <i>Charly</i>, starring Cliff Robertson (who won an Academy Award for Best Actor) and Claire Bloom.

He wrote in both English and French.

Strongly influenced by James Joyce, he is considered one of the last modernists. As an inspiration to many later writers, he is also sometimes considered one of the first postmodernists. He is one of the key writers in what Martin Esslin called the ""Theatre of the Absurd"". His work became increasingly minimalist in his later career.<br /><br />Beckett was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature ""for his writing, which—in new forms for the novel and drama—in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation"".

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.<br /><br />Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, <i>A Game of Thrones</i> tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.","August 6, 1996","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562726234i/13496.jpg","835","2399715","61761","Bantam","August 1, 2005","4.44","A Game of Thrones","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496.A_Game_of_Thrones"

</i> (1951), of American writer <b>Jerome David Salinger</b> often concern troubled, sensitive adolescents. <br /><br />People well know this author for his reclusive nature. He published his last original work in 1965 and gave his last interview in 1980. Reared in city of New York, Salinger began short stories in secondary school and published several stories in the early 1940s before serving in World War II. In 1948, he published the critically acclaimed story ""A Perfect Day for Bananafish"" in <i>The New Yorker</i>, his subsequent home magazine. He released an immediate popular success. His depiction of adolescent alienation and loss of innocence in the protagonist Holden Caulfield especially influenced adolescent readers. Widely read and controversial, sells a quarter-million copies a year.<br /><br />The success led to public attention and scrutiny: reclusive, he published new work less frequently. He followed with a short story collection, <i>Nine Stories</i> (1953), of a novella and a short story, <i>Franny and Zooey</i> (1961), and a collection of two novellas, <i>Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters</i> and <i>Seymour: An Introduction</i> (1963). His last published work, a novella entitled ""Hapworth 16, 1924"", appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i> on June 19, 1965.<br /><br />Afterward, Salinger struggled with unwanted attention, including a legal battle in the 1980s with biographer Ian Hamilton. In the late 1990s, Joyce Maynard, a close ex-lover, and Margaret Salinger, his daughter, wrote and released his memoirs.

A. Milne was born in Kilburn, London, to parents Vince Milne and Sarah Marie Milne (née Heginbotham) and grew up at Henley House School, 6/7 Mortimer Road (now Crescent), Kilburn, a small public school run by his father. One of his teachers was H. G. Wells who taught there in 1889–90. Milne attended Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied on a mathematics scholarship. While there, he edited and wrote for Granta, a student magazine. He collaborated with his brother Kenneth and their articles appeared over the initials AKM. Milne's work came to the attention of the leading British humour magazine Punch, where Milne was to become a contributor and later an assistant editor.<br /> <br />Milne joined the British Army in World War I and served as an officer in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and later, after a debilitating illness, the Royal Corps of Signals. He was discharged on February 14, 1919.<br /> <br />After the war, he wrote a denunciation of war titled <i>Peace with Honour</i> (1934), which he retracted somewhat with 1940's <i>War with Honour</i>. During World War II, Milne was one of the most prominent critics of English writer P. G. Wodehouse, who was captured at his country home in France by the Nazis and imprisoned for a year. Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment, which were broadcast from Berlin. Although the light-hearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans, Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near treason by cooperating with his country's enemy. Wodehouse got some revenge on his former friend by creating fatuous parodies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories, and claiming that Milne ""was probably jealous of all other writers.... But I loved his stuff.""<br /> <br />He married Dorothy ""Daphne"" de Sélincourt in 1913, and their only son, Christopher Robin Milne, was born in 1920. In 1925, A. A. Milne bought a country home, Cotchford Farm, in Hartfield, East Sussex. During World War II, A. A. Milne was Captain of the Home Guard in Hartfield &amp; Forest Row, insisting on being plain 'Mr. Milne' to the members of his platoon. He retired to the farm after a stroke and brain surgery in 1952 left him an invalid and by August 1953 ""he seemed very old and disenchanted"".<br /><br />He was 74 years old when he passed away in 1956.","A.A.

Of the most enduring figures in crime literature, she created Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple.

The Millers had two other children: Margaret Frary Miller (1879–1950), called Madge, who was eleven years Agatha's senior, and Louis Montant Miller (1880–1929), called Monty, ten years older than Agatha. <br /><br />Before marrying and starting a family in London, she had served in a Devon hospital during the First World War, tending to troops coming back from the trenches. During the First World War, she worked at a hospital as a nurse; later working at a hospital pharmacy, a job that influenced her work, as many of the murders in her books are carried out with poison. During the Second World War, she worked as a pharmacy assistant at University College Hospital, London, acquiring a good knowledge of poisons which feature in many of her novels.<br /><br />Her first novel, <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i>, came out in 1920. During her first marriage, Agatha published six novels, a collection of short stories, and a number of short stories in magazines.<br /><br />In late 1926, Agatha's husband, Archie, revealed that he was in love with another woman, Nancy Neele, and wanted a divorce. On 8 December 1926 the couple quarreled, and Archie Christie left their house, Styles, in Sunningdale, Berkshire, to spend the weekend with his mistress at Godalming, Surrey. That same evening Agatha disappeared from her home, leaving behind a letter for her secretary saying that she was going to Yorkshire. Her disappearance caused an outcry from the public, many of whom were admirers of her novels. Despite a massive manhunt, she was not found for eleven days.<br /><br />In 1930, Christie married archaeologist Max Mallowan (Sir Max from 1968) after joining him in an archaeological dig. Their marriage was especially happy in the early years and remained so until Christie's death in 1976.<br /><br />Christie frequently used familiar settings for her stories. Christie's travels with Mallowan contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East. Other novels (such as <i>And Then There Were None</i>) were set in and around Torquay, where she was born. Christie's 1934 novel <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i> was written in the Hotel Pera Palace in Istanbul, Turkey, the southern terminus of the railway. The hotel maintains Christie's room as a memorial to the author. The Greenway Estate in Devon, acquired by the couple as a summer residence in 1938, is now in the care of the National Trust.<br /><br />Christie often stayed at Abney Hall in Cheshire, which was owned by her brother-in-law, James Watts. She based at least two of her stories on the hall: the short story <i>The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding</i>, and the novel <i>After the Funeral</i>.

Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:<br /><br />""Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.""<br /><br />When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale?

</i> (1943). <br /><br />He flew for the first time at the age of 12 years in 192 at the Ambérieu airfield and then determined to a pilot. Even after moving to a school in Switzerland and spending summer vacations at the château of the family at Saint-Maurice-de-Rémens in eastern France, he kept that ambition. He writes repeatedly of the house at Saint-Maurice. <br /><br />Later, in Paris, he failed the entrance exams for the French naval academy and instead enrolled at the prestigious art school l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In 1921, Saint-Exupéry, stationed in Strasbourg, began serving in the military. He learned and forever settled his career path as a pilot. After leaving the service, in 1923, Saint-Exupéry worked in several professions, but in 1926, he went back to flying and signed as a pilot for Aéropostale, a private airline that flew mail from Toulouse, France, to Dakar, Senegal. In 1927, Saint-Exupéry accepted the position of airfield chief for Cape Juby in southern Morocco and began writing his first book, a memoir, called <i>Southern Mail</i>, published in 1929. <br /><br />He then moved briefly to Buenos Aires to oversee the establishment of an Argentinean mail service, returned to Paris in 1931, and then published <i>Night Flight</i>, which won instant success and the prestigious Prix Femina. Always daring Saint-Exupéry tried in 1935 to break the speed record for flying from Paris to Saigon. Unfortunately, his plane crashed in the Libyan Desert, and he and his copilot trudged through the sand for three days to find help. In 1938, a second plane crash, this time as he tried to fly between city of New York and Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, seriously injured him. The crash resulted in a long convalescence in New York. <br /><br />Next novel, <i>Wind, Sand and Stars</i>, published in 1939. A great success, the book won the Grand Prix du Roman (grand prize for novel writing) of Académie Française and the National Book Award in the United States. At the beginning of the Second World War, Saint-Exupéry flew reconnaissance missions for France, but he went to New York to ask the United States for help when the Germans occupied his country. He drew on his wartime experiences to write Flight to Arras and Letter to a Hostage, both published in 1942. His classic The Little Prince appeared in 1943. Later in 1943 Saint-Exupéry rejoined his French air squadron in northern Africa. Despite being forbidden to fly (he was still suffering physically from his earlier plane crashes), Saint-Exupéry insisted on being given a mission. On July 31, 1944, he set out from Borgo, Corsica, to overfly occupied France. He never returned. <br />","Antoine de Saint-Exupéry","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1020792.Antoine_de_Saint_Exup_ry","Paperback","157993","http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&creative=374001&campaign=211041&adid=082VK13VJJCZTQYGWWCZ&index=books&keyword=The+Little+Prince","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Little+Prince&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/The+Little+Prince","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Ftn%3DThe+Little+Prince","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3DThe+Little+Prince","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=The+Little+Prince&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3DThe+Little+Prince","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=The+Little+Prince","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FThe+Little+Prince-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3DThe+Little+Prince","https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=The+Little+Prince","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:The+Little+Prince/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=The+Little+Prince",,,"A pilot stranded in the desert awakes one morning to see, standing before him, the most extraordinary little fellow.

"Guy Montag, Clarisse McClellan, Mildred Montag, Captain Beatty, Professor Faber, The Mechanical Hound","English",,"Prometheus Hall of Fame Award, Geffen Award, California Book Award, Retro Hugo Award","Fahrenheit 451",,"Ray Douglas Bradbury, American novelist, short story writer, essayist, playwright, screenwriter and poet, was born August 22, 1920 in Waukegan, Illinois. He graduated from a Los Angeles high school in 1938. Although his formal education ended there, he became a ""student of life,"" selling newspapers on L.A. street corners from 1938 to 1942, spending his nights in the public library and his days at the typewriter. He became a full-time writer in 1943, and contributed numerous short stories to periodicals before publishing a collection of them, <i>Dark Carnival,</i> in 1947. <br /><br />His reputation as a writer of courage and vision was established with the publication of <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> in 1950, which describes the first attempts of Earth people to conquer and colonize Mars, and the unintended consequences. Next came <i>The Illustrated Man</i> and then, in 1953, <i>Fahrenheit 451,</i> which many consider to be Bradbury's masterpiece, a scathing indictment of censorship set in a future world where the written word is forbidden. In an attempt to salvage their history and culture, a group of rebels memorize entire works of literature and philosophy as their books are burned by the totalitarian state. Other works include <i>The October Country, Dandelion Wine, A Medicine for Melancholy, Something Wicked This Way Comes, I Sing the Body Electric!, Quicker Than the Eye,</i> and <i>Driving Blind.</i> In all, Bradbury has published more than thirty books, close to 600 short stories, and numerous poems, essays, and plays. His short stories have appeared in more than 1,000 school curriculum ""recommended reading"" anthologies. <br /><br />Ray Bradbury's work has been included in four Best American Short Story collections. He has been awarded the O. Henry Memorial Award, the Benjamin Franklin Award, the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement, the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America, the PEN Center USA West Lifetime Achievement Award, among others. In November 2000, the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters was conferred upon Mr. Bradbury at the 2000 National Book Awards Ceremony in New York City. <br /><br />Ray Bradbury has never confined his vision to the purely literary. He has been nominated for an Academy Award (for his animated film Icarus Montgolfier Wright), and has won an Emmy Award (for his teleplay of The Halloween Tree). He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's Ray Bradbury Theater. He was the creative consultant on the United States Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair. In 1982 he created the interior metaphors for the Spaceship Earth display at Epcot Center, Disney World, and later contributed to the conception of the Orbitron space ride at Euro-Disney, France. <br /><br />Married since 1947, Mr. Bradbury and his wife Maggie lived in Los Angeles with their numerous cats. Together, they raised four daughters and had eight grandchildren. Sadly, Maggie passed away in November of 2003. <br /><br />On the occasion of his 80th birthday in August 2000, Bradbury said, ""The great fun in my life has been getting up every morning and rushing to the typewriter because some new idea has hit me. The feeling I have every day is very much the same as it was when I was twelve. In any event, here I am, eighty years old, feeling no different, full of a great sense of joy, and glad for the long life that has been allowed me. I have good plans for the next ten or twenty years, and I hope you'll come along.""","Ray Bradbury","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1630.Ray_Bradbury","Kindle Edition","13079982","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064CPN7I/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064CPN7I/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0064CPN7I&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Fahrenheit+451&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/Fahrenheit+451","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Ftn%3DFahrenheit+451","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3DFahrenheit+451","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Fahrenheit+451&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3DFahrenheit+451","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=Fahrenheit+451","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FFahrenheit+451-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3DFahrenheit+451","https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=Fahrenheit+451","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:Fahrenheit+451/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=Fahrenheit+451",,"<b>Sixty years after its original publication, Ray Bradbury’s internationally acclaimed novel Fahrenheit 451 stands as a classic of world literature set in a bleak, dystopian future.

Vonnegut trained as a chemist and worked as a journalist before joining the U.S. Army and serving in World War II. <br /><br />After the war, he attended University of Chicago as a graduate student in anthropology and also worked as a police reporter at the City News Bureau of Chicago. He left Chicago to work in Schenectady, New York in public relations for General Electric. He attributed his unadorned writing style to his reporting work. <br /><br />His experiences as an advance scout in the Battle of the Bulge, and in particular his witnessing of the bombing of Dresden, Germany whilst a prisoner of war, would inform much of his work. This event would also form the core of his most famous work, Slaughterhouse-Five, the book which would make him a millionaire. This acerbic 200-page book is what most people mean when they describe a work as ""Vonnegutian"" in scope. <br /><br />Vonnegut was a self-proclaimed humanist and socialist (influenced by the style of Indiana's own Eugene V. Debs) and a lifelong supporter of the American Civil Liberties Union.<br /><br />The novelist is known for works blending satire, black comedy and science fiction, such as Slaughterhouse-Five (1969), Cat's Cradle (1963), and Breakfast of Champions (1973) ","Kurt Vonnegut Jr.","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2778055.Kurt_Vonnegut_Jr_","Paperback","4981","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SEGHT6/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385333846/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385333846&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Slaughterhouse-Five&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780385333849","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0385333846","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780385333849","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780385333849?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780385333849&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0385333846","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780385333849","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FSlaughterhouse-Five-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0385333846","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385333849","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0385333846/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0385333846","<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.”<br /><br /> An instant bestseller, <i>Slaughterhouse-Five </i>made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. <br /> Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties.","March 31, 1969","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440319389i/4981.jpg","275","1327155","37321","Dial Press","January 12, 1999","4.09","Slaughterhouse-Five","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4981.Slaughterhouse_Five"

S. Forester, was <i>Shot Down Over Libya</i>. Today the story is published as <i>A Piece of Cake</i>. The story, about his wartime adventures, was bought by the Saturday Evening Post for $900, and propelled him into a career as a writer. Its title was inspired by a highly inaccurate and sensationalized article about the crash that blinded him, which claimed he had been shot down instead of simply having to land because of low fuel.<br /><br />His first children's book was <i>The Gremlins</i>, about mischievous little creatures that were part of RAF folklore. The book was commissioned by Walt Disney for a film that was never made, and published in 1943. Dahl went on to create some of the best-loved children's stories of the 20th century, such as <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>, <i>Matilda</i> and <i>James and the Giant Peach</i>.<br /><br />He also had a successful parallel career as the writer of macabre adult short stories, usually with a dark sense of humour and a surprise ending. Many were originally written for American magazines such as <i>Ladies Home Journal</i>, <i>Harper's</i>, <i>Playboy</i> and <i>The New Yorker</i>, then subsequently collected by Dahl into anthologies, gaining world-wide acclaim. Dahl wrote more than 60 short stories and they have appeared in numerous collections, some only being published in book form after his death. His stories also brought him three Edgar Awards: in 1954, for the collection <i>Someone Like You</i>; in 1959, for the story ""The Landlady""; and in 1980, for the episode of <i>Tales of the Unexpected</i> based on ""Skin"".","Roald Dahl","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4273.Roald_Dahl","Paperback","39988","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141301066/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0141301066&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Matilda&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780141301068","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0141301066","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780141301068","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780141301068?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780141301068&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0141301066","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780141301068","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FMatilda-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0141301066","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780141301068","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0141301066/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0141301066",,"<b><i>“The Trunchbull”</i> is no match for Matilda!</b><br /><br />Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true.

She said he had lived across the ocean near what he called the ""<i>Kamby Bolongo</i>"" and had been out in the forest one day chopping wood to make a drum when he was set upon by four men, beaten, chained and dragged aboard a slave ship bound for Colonial America.<br /><br />Still vividly remembering the stories after he grew up and became a writer, Haley began to search for documentation that might authenticate the narrative. It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of ""the African""—Kunta Kinte—but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the <i>Lord Ligonier</i> to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.<br /><br />Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins. On September 29, 1967, he stood on the dock in Annapolis where his great-great-great-great-grandfather was taken ashore on September 29, 1767. Now he has written the monumental two-century drama of Kunta Kinte and the six generations who came after him—slaves and freedmen, farmers and blacksmiths, lumber mill workers and Pullman porters, lawyers and architects—and one author.<br /><br />But Haley has done more than recapture the history of his own family. As the first black American writer to trace his origins back to their roots, he has told the story of 25,000,000 Americans of African descent. He has rediscovered for an entire people a rich cultural heritage that slavery took away from them, along with their names and their identities. But <i>Roots</i> speaks, finally, not just to blacks, or to whites, but to all people and all races everywhere, for the story it tells is one of the most eloquent testimonials ever written to the indomitability of the human spirit.","August 17, 1976","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329398936i/546018.jpg","888","158272","4127","Dell Publishing","October 1, 1977","4.44","Roots: The Saga of an American Family","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/546018.Roots"

She flourished at Catholic schools and earned a physiology degree from the University of New South Wales in 1963. Planning become a doctor, she found that she had a violent allergy to hospital soap and turned instead to neurophysiology – the study of the nervous system's functions. She found jobs first in London and then at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. <br /><br />After her beloved younger brother Carl died in 1965 at age 25 while rescuing two drowning women in the waters off Crete, a shattered McCullough quit writing. She finally returned to her craft in 1974 with <i>Tim</i>, a critically acclaimed novel about the romance between a female executive and a younger, mentally disabled gardener. As always, the author proved her toughest critic: ""Actually,"" she said, ""it was an icky book, saccharine sweet."" <br /><br />A year later, while on a paltry $10,000 annual salary as a Yale researcher, McCullough – just ""Col"" to her friends – began work on the sprawling <i>The Thorn Birds</i>, about the lives and loves of three generations of an Australian family. Many of its details were drawn from her mother's family's experience as migrant workers, and one character, Dane, was based on brother Carl. <br /><br />Though some reviews were scathing, millions of readers worldwide got caught up in her tales of doomed love and other natural calamities.

And the land itself; stark, relentless in its demands, brilliant in its flowering, prey to gigantic cycles of drought and flood, rich when nature is bountiful, surreal like no other place on earth.<br /><br />Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 0380018179 (ISBN13: 9780380018178)","April 1, 1977","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1548530867i/3412.jpg","692","344185","7589","Avon Books","January 1, 2002","4.24","The Thorn Birds","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3412.The_Thorn_Birds"
"Newland Archer, May Welland, Ellen Olenska, Mrs. Manson Mingott, Mrs. Augusta Welland","English","159308143X","Pulitzer Prize","The Age of Innocence",,"Edith Newbold Jones was born into such wealth and privilege that her family inspired the phrase ""keeping up with the Joneses."" The youngest of three children, Edith spent her early years touring Europe with her parents and, upon the family's return to the United States, enjoyed a privileged childhood in New York and Newport, Rhode Island. Edith's creativity and talent soon became obvious: By the age of eighteen she had written a novella, (as well as witty reviews of it) and published poetry in the Atlantic Monthly.<br /><br />After a failed engagement, Edith married a wealthy sportsman, Edward Wharton. Despite similar backgrounds and a shared taste for travel, the marriage was not a success. Many of Wharton's novels chronicle unhappy marriages, in which the demands of love and vocation often conflict with the expectations of society. Wharton's first major novel, <i>The House of Mirth,</i> published in 1905, enjoyed considerable literary success. <i>Ethan Frome</i> appeared six years later, solidifying Wharton's reputation as an important novelist. Often in the company of her close friend, Henry James, Wharton mingled with some of the most famous writers and artists of the day, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, André Gide, Sinclair Lewis, Jean Cocteau, and Jack London.<br /><br />In 1913 Edith divorced Edward. She lived mostly in France for the remainder of her life. When World War I broke out, she organized hostels for refugees, worked as a fund-raiser, and wrote for American publications from battlefield frontlines. She was awarded the French Legion of Honor for her courage and distinguished work.<br /><br /><i>The Age of Innocence,</i> a novel about New York in the 1870s, earned Wharton the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1921 -- the first time the award had been bestowed upon a woman. Wharton traveled throughout Europe to encourage young authors. She also continued to write, lying in her bed every morning, as she had always done, dropping each newly penned page on the floor to be collected and arranged when she was finished. Wharton suffered a stroke and died on August 11, 1937. She is buried in the American Cemetery in Versailles, France. <br /><i>- Barnesandnoble.com</i>","Edith Wharton","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16.Edith_Wharton","Paperback","53835","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071CLBVXZ/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159308143X/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=159308143X&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Age+of+Innocence&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9781593081430","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D159308143X","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9781593081430","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9781593081430?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781593081430&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D159308143X","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9781593081430","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FThe+Age+of+Innocence-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D159308143X","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781593081430","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:159308143X/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=159308143X","Winner of the 1921 Pulitzer Prize, <i>The Age of Innocence</i> is <b>Edith Wharton</b>’s masterful portrait of desire and betrayal during the sumptuous Golden Age of Old New York, a time when society people “dreaded scandal more than disease.”<br /><br />This is Newland Archer’s world as he prepares to marry the beautiful but conventional May Welland.

To gather information for the novel, Sinclair spent seven weeks undercover working in the meat packing plants of Chicago. These direct experiences exposed the horrific conditions in the U.S. meat packing industry, causing a public uproar that contributed in part to the passage a few months later of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act. <i>The Jungle</i> has remained continuously in print since its initial publication. In 1919, he published <i>The Brass Check</i>, a muckraking exposé of American journalism that publicized the issue of yellow journalism and the limitations of the “free press” in the United States. Four years after the initial publication of <i>The Brass Check</i>, the first code of ethics for journalists was created. <i>Time</i> magazine called him ""a man with every gift except humor and silence.""

He also founded the Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. Less than a year later, he was assassinated in Washington Heights on the first day of National Brotherhood Week.<br /><br />Historian Robin D.G. Kelley wrote, ""Malcolm X has been called many things: Pan-Africanist, father of Black Power, religious fanatic, closet conservative, incipient socialist, and a menace to society. The meaning of his public life — his politics and ideology — is contested in part because his entire body of work consists of a few dozen speeches and a collaborative autobiography whose veracity is challenged. Malcolm has become a sort of tabula rasa, or blank slate, on which people of different positions can write their own interpretations of his politics and legacy.<br />","Malcolm X","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17435.Malcolm_X","Mass Market Paperback","92057","http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&creative=374001&campaign=211041&adid=082VK13VJJCZTQYGWWCZ&index=books&keyword=The+Autobiography+of+Malcolm+X","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Autobiography+of+Malcolm+X&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/The+Autobiography+of+Malcolm+X","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Ftn%3DThe+Autobiography+of+Malcolm+X","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3DThe+Autobiography+of+Malcolm+X","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=The+Autobiography+of+Malcolm+X&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3DThe+Autobiography+of+Malcolm+X","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=The+Autobiography+of+Malcolm+X","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FThe+Autobiography+of+Malcolm+X-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3DThe+Autobiography+of+Malcolm+X","https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=The+Autobiography+of+Malcolm+X","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:The+Autobiography+of+Malcolm+X/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=The+Autobiography+of+Malcolm+X",,,"Alternate cover for ISBN 9780345350688<br /><br />Through a life of passion and struggle, Malcolm X became one of the most influential figures of the 20th Century.

After his father left them when Stephen was two, he and his older brother, David, were raised by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford, Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury, had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by her sisters to take over the physical care of them. Other family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support. After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally challenged.<br /><br />Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and Lisbon Falls High School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated in 1970, with a B.A. in English and qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.<br /><br />He met Tabitha Spruce in the stacks of the Fogler Library at the University, where they both worked as students; they married in January of 1971. As Stephen was unable to find placement as a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.<br /><br />Stephen made his first professional short story sale (""The Glass Floor"") to <i>Startling Mystery Stories</i> in 1967. Throughout the early years of his marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many were gathered into the <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10628.Night_Shift"" title=""Night Shift"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Night Shift</a> collection or appeared in other anthologies.<br /><br />In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching English at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine.

Known to millions around the world as the author of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, Tolkien spent most of his life teaching at the University of Oxford where he was a distinguished academic in the fields of Old and Middle English and Old Norse. His creativity, confined to his spare time, found its outlet in fantasy works, stories for children, poetry, illustration and invented languages and alphabets.<br /><br />Tolkien’s most popular works, <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> are set in Middle-earth, an imagined world with strangely familiar settings inhabited by ancient and extraordinary peoples. Through this secondary world Tolkien writes perceptively of universal human concerns – love and loss, courage and betrayal, humility and pride – giving his books a wide and enduring appeal.<br /><br />Tolkien was an accomplished amateur artist who painted for pleasure and relaxation. He excelled at landscapes and often drew inspiration from his own stories. He illustrated many scenes from <i>The Silmarillion</i>, <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, sometimes drawing or painting as he was writing in order to visualize the imagined scene more clearly.<br /><br />Tolkien was a professor at the Universities of Leeds and Oxford for almost forty years, teaching Old and Middle English, as well as Old Norse and Gothic. His illuminating lectures on works such as the Old English epic poem, <i>Beowulf</i>, illustrate his deep knowledge of ancient languages and at the same time provide new insights into peoples and legends from a remote past.<br /><br />Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa, in 1892 to English parents. He came to England aged three and was brought up in and around Birmingham. He graduated from the University of Oxford in 1915 and saw active service in France during the First World War before being invalided home. After the war he pursued an academic career teaching Old and Middle English. Alongside his professional work, he invented his own languages and began to create what he called a mythology for England; it was this ‘legendarium’ that he would work on throughout his life.

He was recognized as New York State Author for 2001-2003. <br /><br />He was born in Indianapolis, later the setting for many of his novels. He attended Cornell University from 1941 to 1943, where he wrote a column for the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun. Vonnegut trained as a chemist and worked as a journalist before joining the U.S. Army and serving in World War II. <br /><br />After the war, he attended University of Chicago as a graduate student in anthropology and also worked as a police reporter at the City News Bureau of Chicago. He left Chicago to work in Schenectady, New York in public relations for General Electric. He attributed his unadorned writing style to his reporting work. <br /><br />His experiences as an advance scout in the Battle of the Bulge, and in particular his witnessing of the bombing of Dresden, Germany whilst a prisoner of war, would inform much of his work. This event would also form the core of his most famous work, Slaughterhouse-Five, the book which would make him a millionaire. This acerbic 200-page book is what most people mean when they describe a work as ""Vonnegutian"" in scope. <br /><br />Vonnegut was a self-proclaimed humanist and socialist (influenced by the style of Indiana's own Eugene V. Debs) and a lifelong supporter of the American Civil Liberties Union.<br /><br />The novelist is known for works blending satire, black comedy and science fiction, such as Slaughterhouse-Five (1969), Cat's Cradle (1963), and Breakfast of Champions (1973) ","Kurt Vonnegut Jr.","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2778055.Kurt_Vonnegut_Jr_","Paperback","4980","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SEH1R8/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385334206/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385334206&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Breakfast+of+Champions&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780385334204","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0385334206","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780385334204","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780385334204?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780385334204&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0385334206","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780385334204","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FBreakfast+of+Champions-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0385334206","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385334204","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0385334206/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0385334206","<i>Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12502523-breakfast-of-champions"">here</a></i><br /><br />In <i>Breakfast of Champions,</i> one of Kurt Vonnegut’s most beloved characters, the aging writer Kilgore Trout, finds to his horror that a Midwest car dealer is taking his fiction as truth.

Though his parents were both Jewish, they became Christianized, first as Russian Orthodox and later as Tolstoyan Christians. Pasternak's education began in a German Gymnasium in Moscow and was continued at the University of Moscow. Under the influence of the composer Scriabin, Pasternak took up the study of musical composition for six years from 1904 to 1910. By 1912 he had renounced music as his calling in life and went to the University of Marburg, Germany, to study philosophy. After four months there and a trip to Italy, he returned to Russia and decided to dedicate himself to literature.<br /><br />Pasternak's first books of verse went unnoticed. With <i>My Sister Life</i>, 1922, and <i>Themes and Variations</i>, 1923, the latter marked by an extreme, though sober style, Pasternak first gained a place as a leading poet among his Russian contemporaries. In 1924 he published <i>Sublime Malady</i>, which portrayed the 1905 revolt as he saw it, and <i>The Childhood of Luvers</i>, a lyrical and psychological depiction of a young girl on the threshold of womanhood. A collection of four short stories was published the following year under the title <i>Aerial Ways</i>. In 1927 Pasternak again returned to the revolution of 1905 as a subject for two long works: ""Lieutenant Schmidt"", a poem expressing threnodic sorrow for the fate of the Lieutenant, the leader of the mutiny at Sevastopol, and ""The Year 1905"", a powerful but diffuse poem which concentrates on the events related to the revolution of 1905. Pasternak's reticent autobiography, <i>Safe Conduct</i>, appeared in 1931, and was followed the next year by a collection of lyrics, <i>Second Birth</i>, 1932. In 1935 he published translations of some Georgian poets and subsequently translated the major dramas of Shakespeare, several of the works of Goethe, Schiller, Kleist, and Ben Jonson, and poems by Petöfi, Verlaine, Swinburne, Shelley, and others. <i>In Early Trains</i>, a collection of poems written since 1936, was published in 1943 and enlarged and reissued in 1945 as <i>Wide Spaces of the Earth</i>. In 1957 <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>, Pasternak's only novel - except for the earlier ""novel in verse"", <i>Spektorsky</i> (1926) - first appeared in an Italian translation and has been acclaimed by some critics as a successful attempt at combining lyrical-descriptive and epic-dramatic styles. <br /><br />Pasternak lived in Peredelkino, near Moscow, until his death in 1960.","Boris Pasternak","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7902.Boris_Pasternak","Paperback","130440","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JKKVTY6/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679774386/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0679774386&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Doctor+Zhivago&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780679774389","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0679774386","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780679774389","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780679774389?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780679774389&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0679774386","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780679774389","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FDoctor+Zhivago-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0679774386","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780679774389","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0679774386/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0679774386","This epic tale about the effects of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath on a bourgeois family was not published in the Soviet Union until 1987.

When she was a child, Bradley stated that she enjoyed reading adventure fantasy authors such as Henry Kuttner, Edmond Hamilton, and Leigh Brackett, especially when they wrote about ""the glint of strange suns on worlds that never were and never would be."" Her first novel and much of her subsequent work show their influence strongly.<br /><br />Early in her career, writing as Morgan Ives, Miriam Gardner, John Dexter, and Lee Chapman, Marion Zimmer Bradley produced several works outside the speculative fiction genre, including some gay and lesbian pulp fiction novels. For example, <i>I Am a Lesbian</i> was published in 1962. Though relatively tame by today's standards, they were considered pornographic when published, and for a long time she refused to disclose the titles she wrote under these pseudonyms.<br /><br />Her 1958 story <i>The Planet Savers</i> introduced the planet of Darkover, which became the setting of a popular series by Bradley and other authors. The Darkover milieu may be considered as either fantasy with science fiction overtones or as science fiction with fantasy overtones, as Darkover is a lost earth colony where psi powers developed to an unusual degree. Bradley wrote many Darkover novels by herself, but in her later years collaborated with other authors for publication; her literary collaborators have continued the series since her death.<br /><br />Bradley took an active role in science-fiction and fantasy fandom, promoting interaction with professional authors and publishers and making several important contributions to the subculture.<br /><br />For many years, Bradley actively encouraged Darkover fan fiction and reprinted some of it in commercial Darkover anthologies, continuing to encourage submissions from unpublished authors, but this ended after a dispute with a fan over an unpublished Darkover novel of Bradley's that had similarities to some of the fan's stories. As a result, the novel remained unpublished, and Bradley demanded the cessation of all Darkover fan fiction.<br /><br />Bradley was also the editor of the long-running <i>Sword and Sorceress</i> anthology series, which encouraged submissions of fantasy stories featuring original and non-traditional heroines from young and upcoming authors. Although she particularly encouraged young female authors, she was not averse to including male authors in her anthologies. Mercedes Lackey was just one of many authors who first appeared in the anthologies. She also maintained a large family of writers at her home in Berkeley. Ms Bradley was editing the final <i>Sword and Sorceress</i> manuscript up until the week of her death in September of 1999.<br /><br />Probably her most famous single novel is <i>The Mists of Avalon</i>. A retelling of the Camelot legend from the point of view of Morgaine and Gwenhwyfar, it grew into a series of books; like the Darkover series, the later novels are written with or by other authors and have continued to appear after Bradley's death.<br /><br />Her reputation has been posthumously marred by multiple accusations of child sexual abuse by her daughter Moira Greyland, and for allegedly assisting her second husband, convicted child abuser Walter Breen, in sexually abusing multiple unrelated children.<br /><br />(from Wikipedia)","Marion Zimmer Bradley","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4841825.Marion_Zimmer_Bradley","Kindle Edition","40605251","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC1JCQ/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC1JCQ/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000FC1JCQ&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Mists+of+Avalon&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/The+Mists+of+Avalon","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Ftn%3DThe+Mists+of+Avalon","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3DThe+Mists+of+Avalon","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=The+Mists+of+Avalon&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3DThe+Mists+of+Avalon","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=The+Mists+of+Avalon","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FThe+Mists+of+Avalon-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3DThe+Mists+of+Avalon","https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=The+Mists+of+Avalon","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:The+Mists+of+Avalon/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=The+Mists+of+Avalon",,"Here is the magical legend of King Arthur, vividly retold through the eyes and lives of the women who wielded power from behind the throne.

Her books sold more than a billion copies in the English language and a billion in translation. According to Index Translationum, people translated her works into 103 languages at least, the most for an individual author. Of the most enduring figures in crime literature, she created Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple. She atuhored <i>The Mousetrap</i>, the longest-running play in the history of modern theater. <br /><br />The youngest of three children of the Miller family. The Millers had two other children: Margaret Frary Miller (1879–1950), called Madge, who was eleven years Agatha's senior, and Louis Montant Miller (1880–1929), called Monty, ten years older than Agatha. <br /><br />Before marrying and starting a family in London, she had served in a Devon hospital during the First World War, tending to troops coming back from the trenches. During the First World War, she worked at a hospital as a nurse; later working at a hospital pharmacy, a job that influenced her work, as many of the murders in her books are carried out with poison. During the Second World War, she worked as a pharmacy assistant at University College Hospital, London, acquiring a good knowledge of poisons which feature in many of her novels.<br /><br />Her first novel, <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i>, came out in 1920. During her first marriage, Agatha published six novels, a collection of short stories, and a number of short stories in magazines.<br /><br />In late 1926, Agatha's husband, Archie, revealed that he was in love with another woman, Nancy Neele, and wanted a divorce. On 8 December 1926 the couple quarreled, and Archie Christie left their house, Styles, in Sunningdale, Berkshire, to spend the weekend with his mistress at Godalming, Surrey. That same evening Agatha disappeared from her home, leaving behind a letter for her secretary saying that she was going to Yorkshire. Her disappearance caused an outcry from the public, many of whom were admirers of her novels. Despite a massive manhunt, she was not found for eleven days.<br /><br />In 1930, Christie married archaeologist Max Mallowan (Sir Max from 1968) after joining him in an archaeological dig. Their marriage was especially happy in the early years and remained so until Christie's death in 1976.<br /><br />Christie frequently used familiar settings for her stories. Christie's travels with Mallowan contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East. Other novels (such as <i>And Then There Were None</i>) were set in and around Torquay, where she was born. Christie's 1934 novel <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i> was written in the Hotel Pera Palace in Istanbul, Turkey, the southern terminus of the railway. The hotel maintains Christie's room as a memorial to the author.

Even though she died nearly 70 years ago, her books still sell very well.<br /><br />Margaret loved animals. Most of her books have animals as characters in the story. She liked to write books that had a rhythm to them. Sometimes she would put a hard word into the story or poem. She thought this made children think harder when they are reading.<br /><br />She wrote all the time. There are many scraps of paper where she quickly wrote down a story idea or a poem. She said she dreamed stories and then had to write them down in the morning before she forgot them.<br /><br />She tried to write the way children wanted to hear a story, which often isn't the same way an adult would tell a story. She also taught illustrators to draw the way a child saw things. One time she gave two puppies to someone who was going to draw a book with that kind of dog. The illustrator painted many pictures one day and then fell asleep. When he woke up, the papers he painted on were bare. The puppies had licked all the paint off the paper.<br /><br />Margaret died after surgery for a bursting appendix while in France. She had many friends who still miss her.

"Cindy Lou Who, Grinch, Max","English","0007173040",,"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!",,"<b>Theodor Seuss Geisel</b> was born 2 March 1904 in Springfield, Massachusetts. He graduated Dartmouth College in 1925, and proceeded on to Oxford University with the intent of acquiring a doctorate in literature. At Oxford he met Helen Palmer, who he wed in 1927. He returned from Europe in 1927, and began working for a magazine called Judge, the leading humor magazine in America at the time, submitting both cartoons and humorous articles for them. Additionally, he was submitting cartoons to Life, Vanity Fair and Liberty. In some of his works, he'd made reference to an insecticide called Flit. These references gained notice, and led to a contract to draw comic ads for Flit. This association lasted 17 years, gained him national exposure, and coined the catchphrase ""Quick, Henry, the Flit!"" <br /><br />In 1936 on the way to a vacation in Europe, listening to the rhythm of the ship's engines, he came up with And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, which was then promptly rejected by the first 43 publishers he showed it to. Eventually in 1937 a friend published the book for him, and it went on to at least moderate success. <br /><br />During World War II, Geisel joined the army and was sent to Hollywood. Captain Geisel would write for Frank Capra's Signal Corps Unit (for which he won the Legion of Merit) and do documentaries (he won Oscar's for Hitler Lives and Design for Death). He also created a cartoon called Gerald McBoing-Boing which also won him an Oscar. <br /><br />In May of 1954, Life published a report concerning illiteracy among school children. The report said, among other things, that children were having trouble to read because their books were boring. This inspired Geisel's publisher, and prompted him to send Geisel a list of 400 words he felt were important, asked him to cut the list to 250 words (the publishers idea of how many words at one time a first grader could absorb), and write a book. Nine months later, Geisel, using 220 of the words given to him published <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233093.The_Cat_in_the_Hat"" title=""The Cat in the Hat"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The Cat in the Hat</a>
</i>, which went on to instant success. <br /><br />In 1960 Bennett Cerf bet Geisel $50 that he couldn't write an entire book using only fifty words. The result was <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23772.Green_Eggs_and_Ham"" title=""Green Eggs and Ham"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Green Eggs and Ham</a>
</i>. Cerf never paid the $50 from the bet. <br /><br />Helen Palmer Geisel died in 1967. Theodor Geisel married Audrey Stone Diamond in 1968. Theodor Seuss Geisel died 24 September 1991. <br /><br />Also worked under the pen name: <b>

The whole Christmas season!<br />Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.""</i><br /><br /><b>Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time.</b><br /><br />For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His <i>""wonderful, awful""</i> idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.<br /><br />Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small. <br /><br />This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos.","October 12, 1957","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327958149i/113946.jpg","64","398573","4298","Harper Collins Children's Books","October 4, 2004","4.37","How the Grinch Stole Christmas!","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113946.How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas_"

Louis recounts how he became a vampire at the hands of the radiant and sinister Lestat and how he became indoctrinated, unwillingly, into the vampire way of life. His story ebbs and flows through the streets of New Orleans, defining crucial moments such as his discovery of the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her with the last breaths of humanity he has inside. Yet, he makes Claudia a vampire, trapping her womanly passion, will, and intelligence inside the body of a small child. Louis and Claudia form a seemingly unbreakable alliance and even ""settle down"" for a while in the opulent French Quarter. Louis remembers Claudia's struggle to understand herself and the hatred they both have for Lestat that sends them halfway across the world to seek others of their kind. Louis and Claudia are desperate to find somewhere they belong, to find others who understand, and someone who knows what and why they are.<br /><br />Louis and Claudia travel Europe, eventually coming to Paris and the ragingly successful Theatre des Vampires--a theatre of vampires pretending to be mortals pretending to be vampires. Here they meet the magnetic and ethereal Armand, who brings them into a whole society of vampires. But Louis and Claudia find that finding others like themselves provides no easy answers and in fact presents dangers they scarcely imagined.<br /><br />Originally begun as a short story, the book took off as Anne wrote it, spinning the tragic and triumphant life experiences of a soul. As well as the struggles of its characters, Interview captures the political and social changes of two continents. The novel also introduces Lestat, Anne's most enduring character, a heady mixture of attraction and revulsion. The book, full of lush description, centers on the themes of immortality, change, loss, sexuality, and power.<br />source: annerice.com","April 12, 1976","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380631642i/43763.jpg","346","567813","14829","Ballantine Books","August 31, 2004","4.02","Interview with the Vampire","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43763.Interview_with_the_Vampire"

Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.<br /><br />Written in 1953, <i>The Crucible</i> is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's ""witch-hunts"" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, ""Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.""<br /><br />WIth an introduction by Christopher Bigsby.<br />(back cover)","January 22, 1953","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1547467608i/17250.jpg","143","393275","11110","Penguin Books","March 25, 2003","3.6","The Crucible: A Play in Four Acts","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17250.The_Crucible"

"The Narrator, Tyler Durden, Marla Singer","English","0393355942","Oregon Book Award","Fight Club","Fight Club","Written in stolen moments under truck chassis and on park benches to a soundtrack of The Downward Spiral and Pablo Honey, <i>Fight Club</i> came into existence. The adaptation of <i>Fight Club</i> was a flop at the box office, but achieved cult status on DVD. The film’s popularity drove sales of the novel. Chuck put out two novels in 1999, <i>Survivor</i> and <i>Invisible Monsters</i>. <i>Choke</i>, published in 2001, became Chuck’s first New York Times bestseller. Chuck’s work has always been infused with personal experience, and his next novel, <i>Lullaby</i>, was no exception. Chuck credits writing <i>Lullaby</i> with helping him cope with the tragic death of his father. <i>Diary</i> and the non-fiction guide to Portland, <i>Fugitives and Refugees</i>, were released in 2003. While on the road in support of <i>Diary</i>, Chuck began reading a short story entitled 'Guts,' which would eventually become part of the novel <i>Haunted</i>.<br /><br />In the years that followed, he continued to write, publishing the bestselling <i>Rant, Snuff, Pygmy, Tell-All, a 'remix' of Invisible Monsters, Damned</i>, and most recently, <i>Doomed</i>. <br /><br />Chuck also enjoys giving back to his fans, and teaching the art of storytelling has been an important part of that. In 2004, Chuck began submitting essays to ChuckPalahniuk.net on the craft of writing. These were 'How To' pieces, straight out of Chuck's personal bag of tricks, based on the tenants of minimalism he learned from Tom Spanbauer. Every month, a “Homework Assignment” would accompany the lesson, so Workshop members could apply what they had learned. (all 36 of these essays can currently be found on The Cult's sister-site, LitReactor.com).<br /><br />Then, in 2009, Chuck increased his involvement by committing to read and review a selection of fan-written stories each month. The best stories are currently set to be published in <i>Burnt Tongues</i>, a forthcoming anthology, with an introduction written by Chuck himself. <br /><br />His next novel, <i>Beautiful You</i>, is due out in October 2014.<br />","Chuck Palahniuk","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2546.Chuck_Palahniuk","Paperback","36236124","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U0O9FM/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393355942/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393355942&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Fight+Club&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780393355949","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0393355942","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780393355949","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780393355949?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780393355949&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0393355942","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780393355949","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FFight+Club-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0393355942","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780393355949","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0393355942/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0393355942","Chuck Palahniuk showed himself to be his generation’s most visionary satirist in this, his first book. <em>Fight Club</em>’s estranged narrator leaves his lackluster job when he comes under the thrall of Tyler Durden, an enigmatic young man who holds secret after-hours boxing matches in the basement of bars.

He graduated Dartmouth College in 1925, and proceeded on to Oxford University with the intent of acquiring a doctorate in literature. At Oxford he met Helen Palmer, who he wed in 1927. He returned from Europe in 1927, and began working for a magazine called Judge, the leading humor magazine in America at the time, submitting both cartoons and humorous articles for them. Additionally, he was submitting cartoons to Life, Vanity Fair and Liberty. In some of his works, he'd made reference to an insecticide called Flit. These references gained notice, and led to a contract to draw comic ads for Flit. This association lasted 17 years, gained him national exposure, and coined the catchphrase ""Quick, Henry, the Flit!"" <br /><br />In 1936 on the way to a vacation in Europe, listening to the rhythm of the ship's engines, he came up with And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, which was then promptly rejected by the first 43 publishers he showed it to. Eventually in 1937 a friend published the book for him, and it went on to at least moderate success. <br /><br />During World War II, Geisel joined the army and was sent to Hollywood. Captain Geisel would write for Frank Capra's Signal Corps Unit (for which he won the Legion of Merit) and do documentaries (he won Oscar's for Hitler Lives and Design for Death). He also created a cartoon called Gerald McBoing-Boing which also won him an Oscar. <br /><br />In May of 1954, Life published a report concerning illiteracy among school children. The report said, among other things, that children were having trouble to read because their books were boring. This inspired Geisel's publisher, and prompted him to send Geisel a list of 400 words he felt were important, asked him to cut the list to 250 words (the publishers idea of how many words at one time a first grader could absorb), and write a book. Nine months later, Geisel, using 220 of the words given to him published <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233093.The_Cat_in_the_Hat"" title=""The Cat in the Hat"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The Cat in the Hat</a>
</i>, which went on to instant success. <br /><br />In 1960 Bennett Cerf bet Geisel $50 that he couldn't write an entire book using only fifty words. The result was <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23772.Green_Eggs_and_Ham"" title=""Green Eggs and Ham"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Green Eggs and Ham</a>
</i>. Cerf never paid the $50 from the bet. <br /><br />Helen Palmer Geisel died in 1967. Theodor Geisel married Audrey Stone Diamond in 1968. Theodor Seuss Geisel died 24 September 1991. <br /><br />Also worked under the pen name: <b>

His only sibling Alec also became a writer of note. In fact, his book “The Loom of Youth” (1917) a novel about his old boarding school Sherborne caused Evelyn to be expelled from there and placed at Lancing College. He said of his time there, “…the whole of English education when I was brought up was to produce prose writers; it was all we were taught, really.” He went on to Hertford College, Oxford, where he read History. When asked if he took up any sports there he quipped, “I drank for Hertford.” <br /><br />In 1924 Waugh left Oxford without taking his degree. After inglorious stints as a school teacher (he was dismissed for trying to seduce a school matron and/or inebriation), an apprentice cabinet maker and journalist, he wrote and had published his first novel, “Decline and Fall” in 1928. <br /><br />In 1928 he married Evelyn Gardiner. She proved unfaithful, and the marriage ended in divorce in 1930. Waugh would derive parts of “A Handful of Dust” from this unhappy time. His second marriage to Audrey Herbert lasted the rest of his life and begat seven children. It was during this time that he converted to Catholicism. <br /><br />During the thirties Waugh produced one gem after another. From this decade come: “Vile Bodies” (1930), “Black Mischief” (1932), the incomparable “A Handful of Dust” (1934) and “Scoop” (1938). After the Second World War he published what is for many his masterpiece, “Brideshead Revisited,” in which his Catholicism took centre stage. “The Loved One” a scathing satire of the American death industry followed in 1947. After publishing his “Sword of Honour Trilogy” about his experiences in World War II - “Men at Arms” (1952), “Officers and Gentlemen” (1955), “Unconditional Surrender"" (1961) - his career was seen to be on the wane. In fact, “Basil Seal Rides Again” (1963) - his last published novel - received little critical or commercial attention. <br /><br />Evelyn Waugh, considered by many to be the greatest satirical novelist of his day, died on 10 April 1966 at the age of 62.<br /><br />See <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Waugh"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_W...</a>","Evelyn Waugh","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11315.Evelyn_Waugh","Paperback","30933","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316926345/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0316926345&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Brideshead+Revisited&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780316926348","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0316926345","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780316926348","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780316926348?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780316926348&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0316926345","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780316926348","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FBrideshead+Revisited-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0316926345","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316926348","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0316926345/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0316926345",,"The most nostalgic and reflective of Evelyn Waugh's novels, <i>Brideshead Revisited</i> looks back to the golden age before the Second World War.

He is noted for his use of symbolism as a technique in his novels, and he has been criticised for his attachment to mysticism. His other works include <i>Where Angels Fear to Tread</i> (1905), <i>The Longest Journey</i> (1907), <i>A Room with a View</i> (1908) and <i>Maurice</i> (1971), his posthumously published novel which tells of the coming of age of an explicitly gay male character.","E.M.

One of America’s most distinctive voices, Chabon has been called “a magical prose stylist” by the New York Times Book Review, and is known for his lively writing, nostalgia for bygone modes of storytelling, and deep empathy for the human predicament.","Michael Chabon","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2715.Michael_Chabon","Paperback","3985","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070O5F4U/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007C4D1G2/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007C4D1G2&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Amazing+Adventures+of+Kavalier+%26+Clay&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780312282998","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0312282990","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780312282998","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780312282998?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780312282998&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0312282990","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780312282998","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FThe+Amazing+Adventures+of+Kavalier+%26+Clay-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0312282990","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780312282998","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0312282990/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0312282990","Joe Kavalier, a young Jewish artist who has also been trained in the art of Houdini-esque escape, has just smuggled himself out of Nazi-invaded Prague and landed in New York City.

Rowling</b>, pronounced like <i>rolling</i>, her name when her first <i>Harry Potter</i> book was published was simply <b>Joanne Rowling</b>. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose <b>K</b> as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls herself <b>Jo</b> and has said, ""No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was young, unless they were angry."" Following her marriage, she has sometimes used the name <b>Joanne Murray</b> when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of <b>Joanne Kathleen Rowling</b>. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.<br /><br />Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather, Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War.<br /><br />Rowling's sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four. She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the <i>Harry Potter</i> headmaster Albus Dumbledore.<br /><br />As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: ""I can still remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee."" At the age of nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her great aunt, who Rowling said ""taught classics and approved of a thirst for knowledge, even of a questionable kind,"" gave her a very old copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, <i>Hons and Rebels</i>. Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.<br /><br />Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New Yorker, ""I wasn’t particularly happy. I think it’s a dreadful time of life."" She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science department. Rowling said of her adolescence, ""Hermione [a bookish, know-it-all <i>Harry Potter</i> character] is loosely based on me. She's a caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud of."" Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived, remembers her as ""not exceptional"" but ""one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English."" Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says inspired the one in her books.","J.K.

"Sam-I-Am","English","0394800168",,"Green Eggs and Ham",,"<b>Theodor Seuss Geisel</b> was born 2 March 1904 in Springfield, Massachusetts. He graduated Dartmouth College in 1925, and proceeded on to Oxford University with the intent of acquiring a doctorate in literature. At Oxford he met Helen Palmer, who he wed in 1927. He returned from Europe in 1927, and began working for a magazine called Judge, the leading humor magazine in America at the time, submitting both cartoons and humorous articles for them. Additionally, he was submitting cartoons to Life, Vanity Fair and Liberty. In some of his works, he'd made reference to an insecticide called Flit. These references gained notice, and led to a contract to draw comic ads for Flit. This association lasted 17 years, gained him national exposure, and coined the catchphrase ""Quick, Henry, the Flit!"" <br /><br />In 1936 on the way to a vacation in Europe, listening to the rhythm of the ship's engines, he came up with And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, which was then promptly rejected by the first 43 publishers he showed it to. Eventually in 1937 a friend published the book for him, and it went on to at least moderate success. <br /><br />During World War II, Geisel joined the army and was sent to Hollywood. Captain Geisel would write for Frank Capra's Signal Corps Unit (for which he won the Legion of Merit) and do documentaries (he won Oscar's for Hitler Lives and Design for Death). He also created a cartoon called Gerald McBoing-Boing which also won him an Oscar. <br /><br />In May of 1954, Life published a report concerning illiteracy among school children. The report said, among other things, that children were having trouble to read because their books were boring. This inspired Geisel's publisher, and prompted him to send Geisel a list of 400 words he felt were important, asked him to cut the list to 250 words (the publishers idea of how many words at one time a first grader could absorb), and write a book. Nine months later, Geisel, using 220 of the words given to him published <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233093.The_Cat_in_the_Hat"" title=""The Cat in the Hat"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The Cat in the Hat</a>
</i>, which went on to instant success. <br /><br />In 1960 Bennett Cerf bet Geisel $50 that he couldn't write an entire book using only fifty words. The result was <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23772.Green_Eggs_and_Ham"" title=""Green Eggs and Ham"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Green Eggs and Ham</a>
</i>. Cerf never paid the $50 from the bet. <br /><br />Helen Palmer Geisel died in 1967. Theodor Geisel married Audrey Stone Diamond in 1968. Theodor Seuss Geisel died 24 September 1991. <br /><br />Also worked under the pen name: <b>

After his father left them when Stephen was two, he and his older brother, David, were raised by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford, Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury, had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by her sisters to take over the physical care of them. Other family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support. After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally challenged.<br /><br />Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and Lisbon Falls High School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated in 1970, with a B.A. in English and qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.<br /><br />He met Tabitha Spruce in the stacks of the Fogler Library at the University, where they both worked as students; they married in January of 1971. As Stephen was unable to find placement as a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.<br /><br />Stephen made his first professional short story sale (""The Glass Floor"") to <i>Startling Mystery Stories</i> in 1967.

He studied and briefly practised medicine and, after indigent wanderings through revolutionary Russia and the Caucasus, he settled in Moscow in 1921. His sympathetic portrayal of White characters in his stories, in the plays <i>The Days of the Turbins (The White Guard)</i>, which enjoyed great success at the Moscow Art Theatre in 1926, and Flight (1927), and his satirical treatment of the officials of the New Economic Plan, led to growing criticism, which became violent after the play, <i>The Purple Island</i>. His later works treat the subject of the artist and the tyrant under the guise of historical characters, with plays such as Molière, staged in 1936, <i>Don Quixote</i>, staged in 1940, and Pushkin, staged in 1943. He also wrote a brilliant biography, highly original in form, of his literary hero, Molière, but <i>The Master and Margarita</i>, a fantasy novel about the devil and his henchmen set in modern Moscow, is generally considered his masterpiece. Fame, at home and abroad, was not to come until a quarter of a century after his death in Moscow in 1940. <br /><br /><i> <b>Detailed Version</b> </i><br /><br /><i><b>Mikhaíl Afanasyevich Bulgakov</b> (Russian: <b><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17014442.___________________________"" title=""Михаил Афанасьевич Булгаков"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Михаил Афанасьевич Булгаков</a>)</b> was the first of six children in the family of a theology professor. His family belonged to the intellectual elite of Kyiv. Bulgakov and his brothers took part in the demonstration commemorating the death of Leo Tolstoy. Bulgakov later graduated with honors from the Medical School of Kyiv University in 1915. He married his classmate Tatiana Lappa, who became his assistant at surgeries and in his doctor's office. He practiced medicine, specializing in venereal and other infectious diseases, from 1915 to 1919 (he later wrote about the experience in ""Notes of a Young Doctor."")<br /><br />He joined the anti-communist White Army during the Russian Civil War. After the Civil War, he tried (unsuccesfully) to emigrate from Russia to reunite with his brother in Paris. Several times he was almost killed by opposing forces on both sides of the Russian Civil War, but soldiers needed doctors, so Bulgakov was left alive. He provided medical help to the Chehchens, Caucasians, Cossacs, Russians, the Whites, and the Reds.<br /><br />In 1921, Bulgakov moved to Moscow. There he became a writer and became friends with Valentin Katayev, Yuri Olesha, Ilya Ilf, Yevgeni Petrov, and Konstantin Paustovsky. Later, he met Mikhail Zoschenko, Anna Akhmatova, Viktor Ardov, Sergei Mikhalkov, and Kornei Chukovsky. Bulgakov's plays at the Moscow Art Theatre were directed by Stanislavsky and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko. <br /><br />Bugakov's own way of life and his witty criticism of the ugly realities of life in the Soviet Union caused him much trouble. His story ""Heart of a Dog"" (1925) is a bitter satire about the loss of civilized values in Russia under the Soviet system. Soon after, Bulgakov was interrogated by the Soviet secret service, OGPU. After interrogations, his personal diary and several unfinished works were confiscated by the secret service. His plays were banned in all theaters, which terminated his income. Destitute, he wrote to his brother in Paris about his terrible life and poverty in Moscow. Bulgakov distanced himself from the Proletariat Writer's Union because he refused to write about the peasants and proletariat. He adapted ""Dead Souls"" by Nikolai Gogol for the stage; it became a success but was soon banned.<br /><br />He took a risk and wrote a letter to Joseph Stalin with an ultimatum: ""Let me out of the Soviet Union, or restore my work at the theaters."" On the 18th of April of 1930, Bulgakov received a telephone call from Joseph Stalin. The dictator told the writer to fill an employment application at the Moscow Art Theater. Gradually, Bulgakov's plays were back in the repertoire of the Moscow Art Theatre.

This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.<br /><br />""When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" <br /><br />So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy—exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling—does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. <br /><br />Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors—yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. <br /><br />Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.","September 5, 1996","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348317139i/252577.jpg","452","615624","13862","Harper Perennial","October 3, 2005","4.14","Angela's Ashes","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/252577.Angela_s_Ashes"

"Maria, Pilar, Robert Jordan, Anselmo, El Sordo, Pablo Saler","English",,,"For Whom the Bell Tolls",,"Terse literary style of <b>Ernest Miller Hemingway</b>, an American writer, ambulance driver of World War I , journalist, and expatriate in Paris during the 1920s, marks short stories and novels, such as <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3876.The_Sun_Also_Rises"" title=""The Sun Also Rises"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The Sun Also Rises</a>

</i> (1952), which concern courageous, lonely characters, and he won the Nobel Prize of 1954 for literature.<br /><br />Economical and understated style of Hemingway strongly influenced 20th-century fiction, whereas his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s. He published seven novels, six short story collections and two nonfiction works. Survivors published posthumously three novels, four collections of short stories, and three nonfiction works. People consider many of these classics. <br /><br />After high school, Hemingway reported for a few months for the Kansas City <i>Star</i> before leaving for the Italian front to enlist. In 1918, someone seriously wounded him, who returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10799.A_Farewell_to_Arms"" title=""A Farewell to Arms"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">A Farewell to Arms</a>
</i>. In 1922, he married Hadley Richardson, the first of his four wives. The couple moved, and he worked as a foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the expatriate community of the ""lost generation"" of 1920s. <br /><br />After his divorce of 1927 from Hadley Richardson, Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer. At the Spanish civil war, he acted as a journalist; afterward, they divorced, and he wrote <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46170.For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls"" title=""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a>
</i>. Hemingway maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida, and Cuba during the 1930s and 1940s. <br /><br />Martha Gellhorn served as third wife of Hemingway in 1940. When he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II, they separated; he presently witnessed at the Normandy landings and liberation of Paris.<br /><br />Shortly after 1952, Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where two plane crashes almost killed him and left him in pain and ill health for much of the rest of his life. Nevertheless, in 1959, he moved from Cuba to Ketchum, Idaho, where he committed suicide in the summer of 1961.

"Billy Colman, Old Dan, Little Ann","English","0375806814","Massachusetts Children's Book Award, North Dakota Children's Choice Award","Where the Red Fern Grows",," Wilson Rawls was born on September 24, 1913, in the Ozark country of Scraper, Oklahoma. His mother home-schooled her children, and after Rawls read Jack London's canine-centered tale Call of the Wild, he decided to become a writer.<br /><br />But the Great Depression hit the United States in 1929, and Rawls left home to find work. His family moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1935, and he came home each fall to work and hunt. He wrote stories while he traveled, but his lack of formal education hampered his grammar, and he could not sell anything. In 1958, he gave up on his dream and burned all his work. He later revealed his literary desires to his wife, Sophie, and she encouraged him to keep writing.<br /><br />In a three-week burst, Rawls wrote Where the Red Fern Grows, a highly autobiographical and poignant account of a boy, his two hounds, and raccoon-hunting in the Ozark Mountains. His wife edited his grammar and, after serialization in the ""Saturday Evening Post,"" Doubleday published the novel in 1961. By the late 1960s, word-of-mouth helped the book become a classic for young readers. Rawls wrote (and Sophie edited) one more book, The Summer of the Monkeys, in 1976. This, too, became a classic. Rawls died in 1984 in Idaho Falls, Idaho.","Wilson Rawls","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6810.Wilson_Rawls","Mass Market Paperback","10365","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G606EO/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375806814/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0375806814&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Where+the+Red+Fern+Grows&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780375806810","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0375806814","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780375806810","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780375806810?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780375806810&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0375806814","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780375806810","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FWhere+the+Red+Fern+Grows-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0375806814","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780375806810","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0375806814/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0375806814","<b>Billy, Old Dan, and Little Ann—a boy and his two dogs...</b><br /><br />A loving threesome, they ranged the dark hills and river bottoms of Cherokee County.

He was recognized as New York State Author for 2001-2003. <br /><br />He was born in Indianapolis, later the setting for many of his novels. He attended Cornell University from 1941 to 1943, where he wrote a column for the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun. Vonnegut trained as a chemist and worked as a journalist before joining the U.S. Army and serving in World War II. <br /><br />After the war, he attended University of Chicago as a graduate student in anthropology and also worked as a police reporter at the City News Bureau of Chicago. He left Chicago to work in Schenectady, New York in public relations for General Electric. He attributed his unadorned writing style to his reporting work. <br /><br />His experiences as an advance scout in the Battle of the Bulge, and in particular his witnessing of the bombing of Dresden, Germany whilst a prisoner of war, would inform much of his work. This event would also form the core of his most famous work, Slaughterhouse-Five, the book which would make him a millionaire. This acerbic 200-page book is what most people mean when they describe a work as ""Vonnegutian"" in scope. <br /><br />Vonnegut was a self-proclaimed humanist and socialist (influenced by the style of Indiana's own Eugene V. Debs) and a lifelong supporter of the American Civil Liberties Union.<br /><br />The novelist is known for works blending satire, black comedy and science fiction, such as Slaughterhouse-Five (1969), Cat's Cradle (1963), and Breakfast of Champions (1973) ","Kurt Vonnegut Jr.","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2778055.Kurt_Vonnegut_Jr_","Paperback","135479","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SEH13C/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140285601/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0140285601&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Cat%27s+Cradle&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780140285604","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0140285601","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780140285604","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780140285604?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780140285604&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0140285601","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780140285604","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FCat%27s+Cradle-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0140285601","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780140285604","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0140285601/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0140285601","<b>Told with deadpan humour and bitter irony, Kurt Vonnegut's cult tale of global destruction preys on our deepest fears of witnessing Armageddon and, worse still, surviving it ...</b><br /><br />Dr Felix Hoenikker, one of the founding 'fathers' of the atomic bomb, has left a deadly legacy to the world.

"Stephen Dedalus, Simon Dedalus, Fr. John Conmee, Mary Dedalus","English","0142437344",,"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man",,"A profound influence of literary innovations of Irish writer <b>James Augustine Aloysius Joyce</b> on modern fiction includes his works, <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/338798.Ulysses"" title=""Ulysses"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Ulysses</a>
</i> (1922) and <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11013.Finnegans_Wake"" title=""Finnegans Wake"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Finnegans Wake</a>
</i> (1939). <br /><br />People note this novelist for his experimental use of language in these works. Technical innovations of Joyce in the art of the novel include an extensive use of interior monologue; he used a complex network of symbolic parallels, drawn from the mythology, history, and literature, and he created a unique language of invented words, puns, and allusions. <br /><br />John Stanislaus Joyce, an impoverished gentleman and father of James Joyce, nine younger surviving siblings, and two other siblings who died of typhoid, failed in a distillery business and tried all kinds of other professions, including politics and tax collecting. The Roman Catholic Church dominated life of Mary Jane Murray, an accomplished pianist and his mother. In spite of poverty, the family struggled to maintain a solid middle-class façade. <br /><br />Jesuits at Clongowes Wood college, Clane, and then Belvedere college in Dublin educated Joyce from the age of six years; he graduated in 1897. In 1898, he entered the University College, Dublin. Joyce published first an essay on <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/634115.When_We_Dead_Awaken"" title=""When We Dead Awaken"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">When We Dead Awaken</a>

At this time, he also began writing lyric poems. <br /><br />After graduation in 1902, the twenty-year-old Joyce went to Paris, where he worked as a journalist, as a teacher, and in other occupations under difficult financial conditions. He spent a year in France, and when a telegram about his dying mother arrived, he returned. Not long after her death, Joyce traveled again. He left Dublin in 1904 with Nora Barnacle, a chambermaid, whom he married in 1931. <br /><br />Joyce published <i>
  <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11012.Dubliners"" title=""Dubliners"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Dubliners</a>
</i> in 1914, <i>

</i> in 1918 and <i>Ulysses</i> in 1922. In 1907, Joyce published a collection of poems, <i>

</i>.<br /><br />At the outset of the Great War, Joyce moved with his family to Zürich. In Zürich, Joyce started to develop the early chapters of <i>Ulysses</i>, first published in France because of censorship troubles in the Great Britain and the United States, where the book became legally available only in 1933. <br /><br />In March 1923, Joyce in Paris started <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, his second major work; glaucoma caused chronic eye troubles that he suffered at the same time. <i>Transatlantic review</i> of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1209.Ford_Madox_Ford"" title=""Ford Madox Ford"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Ford Madox Ford</a> in April 1924 carried the first segment of the novel, called part of <i>Work in Progress</i>. He published the final version in 1939.<br /><br />Some critics considered the work a masterpiece, though many readers found it incomprehensible. After the fall of France in World War II, Joyce returned to Zürich, where he died, still disappointed with the reception of <i>Finnegans Wake</i>.<br />","James Joyce","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5144.James_Joyce","Paperback","7588","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B9YWQS7V/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142437344/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0142437344&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=A+Portrait+of+the+Artist+as+a+Young+Man&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780142437346","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0142437344","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780142437346","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780142437346?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780142437346&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0142437344","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780142437346","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FA+Portrait+of+the+Artist+as+a+Young+Man-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0142437344","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780142437346","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0142437344/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0142437344","The portrayal of Stephen Dedalus's Dublin childhood and youth, his quest for identity through art and his gradual emancipation from the claims of family, religion and Ireland itself, is also an oblique self-portrait of the young James Joyce and a universal testament to the artist's 'eternal imagination'.

Rowling</b>, pronounced like <i>rolling</i>, her name when her first <i>Harry Potter</i> book was published was simply <b>Joanne Rowling</b>. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose <b>K</b> as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls herself <b>Jo</b> and has said, ""No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was young, unless they were angry."" Following her marriage, she has sometimes used the name <b>Joanne Murray</b> when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of <b>Joanne Kathleen Rowling</b>. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.<br /><br />Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather, Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War.<br /><br />Rowling's sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four. She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the <i>Harry Potter</i> headmaster Albus Dumbledore.<br /><br />As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: ""I can still remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee."" At the age of nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her great aunt, who Rowling said ""taught classics and approved of a thirst for knowledge, even of a questionable kind,"" gave her a very old copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, <i>Hons and Rebels</i>. Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.<br /><br />Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New Yorker, ""I wasn’t particularly happy. I think it’s a dreadful time of life."" She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science department. Rowling said of her adolescence, ""Hermione [a bookish, know-it-all <i>Harry Potter</i> character] is loosely based on me. She's a caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud of."" Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived, remembers her as ""not exceptional"" but ""one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English."" Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says inspired the one in her books.","J.K.

His work is marked by keen intelligence and wit, a profound awareness of social injustice, an intense opposition to totalitarianism, a passion for clarity in language, and a belief in democratic socialism.<br /><br />In addition to his literary career Orwell served as a police officer with the Indian Imperial Police in Burma from 1922-1927 and fought with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War from 1936-1937. Orwell was severely wounded when he was shot through his throat. Later the organization that he had joined when he joined the Republican cause, The Workers Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), was painted by the pro-Soviet Communists as a Trotskyist organization (Trotsky was Joseph Stalin's enemy) and disbanded. Orwell and his wife were accused of ""rabid Trotskyism"" and tried in absentia in Barcelona, along with other leaders of the POUM, in 1938. However by then they had escaped from Spain and returned to England. <br /><br />Between 1941 and 1943, Orwell worked on propaganda for the BBC. In 1943, he became literary editor of the Tribune, a weekly left-wing magazine. He was a prolific polemical journalist, article writer, literary critic, reviewer, poet, and writer of fiction, and, considered perhaps the twentieth century's best chronicler of English culture. <br /><br />Orwell is best known for the dystopian novel <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> (published in 1949) and the satirical novella <i>Animal Farm</i> (1945) — they have together sold more copies than any two books by any other twentieth-century author. His 1938 book <i>Homage to Catalonia</i>, an account of his experiences as a volunteer on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, together with numerous essays on politics, literature, language, and culture, have been widely acclaimed.<br /> <br />Orwell's influence on contemporary culture, popular and political, continues decades after his death. Several of his neologisms, along with the term ""Orwellian"" — now a byword for any oppressive or manipulative social phenomenon opposed to a free society — have entered the vernacular.","George Orwell","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3706.George_Orwell","Mass Market Paperback","170448","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451526341/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0451526341&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Animal+Farm&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780451526342","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0451526341","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780451526342","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780451526342?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780451526342&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0451526341","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780451526342","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FAnimal+Farm-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0451526341","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780451526342","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0451526341/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0451526341",,"<i>Librarian's note: There is an Alternate Cover Edition for this edition of this book <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13456059-animal-farm"">here</a>.</i><br /><br />A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals.

Known to millions around the world as the author of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, Tolkien spent most of his life teaching at the University of Oxford where he was a distinguished academic in the fields of Old and Middle English and Old Norse. His creativity, confined to his spare time, found its outlet in fantasy works, stories for children, poetry, illustration and invented languages and alphabets.<br /><br />Tolkien’s most popular works, <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> are set in Middle-earth, an imagined world with strangely familiar settings inhabited by ancient and extraordinary peoples. Through this secondary world Tolkien writes perceptively of universal human concerns – love and loss, courage and betrayal, humility and pride – giving his books a wide and enduring appeal.<br /><br />Tolkien was an accomplished amateur artist who painted for pleasure and relaxation. He excelled at landscapes and often drew inspiration from his own stories. He illustrated many scenes from <i>The Silmarillion</i>, <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, sometimes drawing or painting as he was writing in order to visualize the imagined scene more clearly.<br /><br />Tolkien was a professor at the Universities of Leeds and Oxford for almost forty years, teaching Old and Middle English, as well as Old Norse and Gothic. His illuminating lectures on works such as the Old English epic poem, <i>Beowulf</i>, illustrate his deep knowledge of ancient languages and at the same time provide new insights into peoples and legends from a remote past.<br /><br />Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa, in 1892 to English parents. He came to England aged three and was brought up in and around Birmingham. He graduated from the University of Oxford in 1915 and saw active service in France during the First World War before being invalided home. After the war he pursued an academic career teaching Old and Middle English. Alongside his professional work, he invented his own languages and began to create what he called a mythology for England; it was this ‘legendarium’ that he would work on throughout his life. But his literary work did not start and end with Middle-earth, he also wrote poetry, children’s stories and fairy tales for adults. He died in 1973 and is buried in Oxford where he spent most of his adult life.","J.R.R.

Garcí­a Márquez, familiarly known as ""Gabo"" in his native country, was considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century. In 1982, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.<br /><br />He studied at the University of Bogotá and later worked as a reporter for the Colombian newspaper <i>El Espectador</i> and as a foreign correspondent in Rome, Paris, Barcelona, Caracas, and New York. He wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best-known for his novels, such as <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> (1967) and <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i> (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magical realism, which uses magical elements and events in order to explain real experiences. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo, and most of them express the theme of solitude.<br /><br />Having previously written shorter fiction and screenplays, García Márquez sequestered himself away in his Mexico City home for an extended period of time to complete his novel <i>Cien años de soledad</i>, or <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>, published in 1967. The author drew international acclaim for the work, which ultimately sold tens of millions of copies worldwide. García Márquez is credited with helping introduce an array of readers to magical realism, a genre that combines more conventional storytelling forms with vivid, layers of fantasy.<br /><br />Another one of his novels, <i>El amor en los tiempos del cólera</i> (1985), or <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i>, drew a large global audience as well. The work was partially based on his parents' courtship and was adapted into a 2007 film starring Javier Bardem. García Márquez wrote seven novels during his life, with additional titles that include <i>El general en su laberinto</i> (1989), or <i>The General in His Labyrinth</i>, and <i>Del amor y otros demonios</i> (1994), or <i>Of Love and Other Demons</i>.<br /><br />(Arabic: <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5029628._"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">جابرييل جارسيا ماركيز</a>) (Hebrew: <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7091051._"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">גבריאל גארסיה מרקס</a>) (Ukrainian: <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14544328.______________________"" title=""Ґабріель Ґарсія Маркес"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Ґабріель Ґарсія Маркес</a>) (Belarussian: <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/43500299.______________________"" title=""Габрыель Гарсія Маркес"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Габрыель Гарсія Маркес</a>) (Russian: <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8327668.______________________"" title=""Габриэль Гарсия Маркес"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Габриэль Гарсия Маркес</a>)","Gabriel García Márquez","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13450.Gabriel_Garc_a_M_rquez","Mass Market Paperback","320","http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&creative=374001&campaign=211041&adid=082VK13VJJCZTQYGWWCZ&index=books&keyword=One+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=One+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/One+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Ftn%3DOne+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3DOne+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=One+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3DOne+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=One+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FOne+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3DOne+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude","https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=One+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:One+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=One+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude",,,"The brilliant, bestselling, landmark novel that tells the story of the Buendia family, and chronicles the irreconcilable conflict between the desire for solitude and the need for love—in rich, imaginative prose that has come to define an entire genre known as ""magical realism.""","May 1, 1967","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327881361i/320.jpg","417","933752","42992","Harper","June 24, 2003","4.11","One Hundred Years of Solitude","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320.One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude"

</i> (1932), best-known work of British writer <b>Aldous Leonard Huxley</b>, paints a grim picture of a scientifically organized utopia. <br /><br />This most prominent member of the famous Huxley family of England spent the part of his life from 1937 in Los Angeles in the United States until his death. Best known for his novels and wide-ranging output of essays, he also published short stories, poetry, travel writing, and film stories and scripts. Through novels and essays, Huxley functioned as an examiner and sometimes critic of social mores, norms and ideals. Spiritual subjects, such as parapsychology and philosophical mysticism, interested Huxley, a humanist, towards the end of his life. People widely acknowledged him as one of the pre-eminent intellectuals of his time before the end of his life. <br />","Aldous Huxley","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3487.Aldous_Huxley","Paperback","5129","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060929871/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060929871&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Brave+New+World&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780060929879","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0060929871","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780060929879","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780060929879?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780060929879&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0060929871","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780060929879","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FBrave+New+World-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0060929871","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780060929879","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0060929871/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0060929871",,"<i>Brave New World</i> is a dystopian novel by English author Aldous Huxley, written in 1931 and published in 1932.

Rowling</b>, pronounced like <i>rolling</i>, her name when her first <i>Harry Potter</i> book was published was simply <b>Joanne Rowling</b>. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose <b>K</b> as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls herself <b>Jo</b> and has said, ""No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was young, unless they were angry."" Following her marriage, she has sometimes used the name <b>Joanne Murray</b> when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of <b>Joanne Kathleen Rowling</b>. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.<br /><br />Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather, Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War.<br /><br />Rowling's sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four. She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the <i>Harry Potter</i> headmaster Albus Dumbledore.<br /><br />As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: ""I can still remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee."" At the age of nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her great aunt, who Rowling said ""taught classics and approved of a thirst for knowledge, even of a questionable kind,"" gave her a very old copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, <i>Hons and Rebels</i>. Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.<br /><br />Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New Yorker, ""I wasn’t particularly happy. I think it’s a dreadful time of life."" She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science department. Rowling said of her adolescence, ""Hermione [a bookish, know-it-all <i>Harry Potter</i> character] is loosely based on me. She's a caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud of."" Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived, remembers her as ""not exceptional"" but ""one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English."" Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says inspired the one in her books.","J.K.

"George Milton, Lennie Small, Candy, Curley, Curley's Wife, Slim, Crooks, Whit, Carlson","English","0142000671","New York Drama Critics' Circle Award","Of Mice and Men ",,"<b>John Ernst Steinbeck Jr.</b> (1902-1968) was an American writer. He wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, published in 1939, and the novella, <i>Of Mice and Men</i>, published in 1937. In all, he wrote twenty-five books, including sixteen novels, six non-fiction books and several collections of short stories. <br /><br />In 1962, Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature.<br /><br />Steinbeck grew up in the Salinas Valley region of California, a culturally diverse place of rich migratory and immigrant history. This upbringing imparted a regionalistic flavor to his writing, giving many of his works a distinct sense of place. <br /><br />Steinbeck moved briefly to New York City, but soon returned home to California to begin his career as a writer. Most of his earlier work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years. An exception was his first novel Cup of Gold which concerns the pirate Henry Morgan, whose adventures had captured Steinbeck's imagination as a child.<br /><br />In his subsequent novels, Steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in California. Later, he used real historical conditions and events in the first half of 20th century America, which he had experienced first-hand as a reporter. <br /><br />Steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters; his works examined the lives of the working class and migrant workers during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. His later body of work reflected his wide range of interests, including marine biology, politics, religion, history, and mythology. <br /><br />One of his last published works was <i>Travels with Charley</i>, a travelogue of a road trip he took in 1960 to rediscover America. He died in 1968 in New York of a heart attack, and his ashes are interred in Salinas.<br /><br />Seventeen of his works, including <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> (1940), <i>Cannery Row</i> (1945), <i>The Pearl</i> (1947), and <i>East of Eden</i> (1952), went on to become Hollywood films, and Steinbeck also achieved success as a Hollywood writer, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Story in 1944 for Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Lifeboat.</i>","John Steinbeck","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck","Paperback","890","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000671/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0142000671&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Of+Mice+and+Men&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780142000670","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0142000671","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780142000670","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780142000670?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780142000670&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0142000671","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780142000670","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FOf+Mice+and+Men-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0142000671","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780142000670","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0142000671/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0142000671",,"<b>

</b><br /><br />They are an unlikely pair: George is <i>""small and quick and dark of face"";</i> Lennie, a man of tremendous size, has the mind of a young child. Yet they have formed a <i>""family,""</i> clinging together in the face of loneliness and alienation. Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. But George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own.<br /><br />While the powerlessness of the laboring class is a recurring theme in Steinbeck's work of the late 1930s, he narrowed his focus when composing <i>Of Mice and Men</i>, creating an intimate portrait of two men facing a world marked by petty tyranny, misunderstanding, jealousy, and callousness. But though the scope is narrow, the theme is universal: a friendship and a shared dream that makes an individual's existence meaningful.<br /><br />A unique perspective on life's hardships, this story has achieved the status of timeless classic due to its remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films.","February 25, 1937","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511302904i/890.jpg","107","2449822","48891","Penguin Books","January 1, 2002","3.88","Of Mice and Men","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/890.Of_Mice_and_Men"

My older sister, Helen, was very much like our mother: gentle, family-oriented, eager to please. Little brother Jon was the only boy and had interests that he shared with Dad; together they were always working on electric trains and erector sets; and later, when Jon was older, they always seemed to have their heads under the raised hood of a car. That left me in-between, and exactly where I wanted most to be: on my own. I was a solitary child who lived in the world of books and my own vivid imagination.<br /><br />Because my father was a career military officer - an Army dentist - I lived all over the world. I was born in Hawaii, moved from there to New York, spent the years of World War II in my mother’s hometown: Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and from there went to Tokyo when I was eleven. High school was back in New York City, but by the time I went to college (Brown University in Rhode Island), my family was living in Washington, D.C.<br /><br />I married young. I had just turned nineteen - just finished my sophomore year in college - when I married a Naval officer and continued the odyssey that military life requires. California. Connecticut (a daughter born there). Florida (a son). South Carolina. Finally Cambridge, Massachusetts, when my husband left the service and entered Harvard Law School (another daughter; another son) and then to Maine - by now with four children under the age of five in tow. My children grew up in Maine. So did I. I returned to college at the University of Southern Maine, got my degree, went to graduate school, and finally began to write professionally, the thing I had dreamed of doing since those childhood years when I had endlessly scribbled stories and poems in notebooks.<br /><br />After my marriage ended in 1977, when I was forty, I settled into the life I have lived ever since. Today I am back in Cambridge, Massachusetts, living and writing in a house dominated by a very shaggy Tibetan Terrier named Bandit. For a change of scenery Martin and I spend time in Maine, where we have an old (it was built in 1768!) farmhouse on top of a hill. In Maine I garden, feed birds, entertain friends, and read...<br /><br />My books have varied in content and style. Yet it seems that all of them deal, essentially, with the same general theme: the importance of human connections. A Summer to Die, my first book, was a highly fictionalized retelling of the early death of my sister, and of the effect of such a loss on a family. Number the Stars, set in a different culture and era, tells the same story: that of the role that we humans play in the lives of our fellow beings.<br /><br />The Giver - and Gathering Blue, and the newest in the trilogy: Messenger - take place against the background of very different cultures and times. Though all three are broader in scope than my earlier books, they nonetheless speak to the same concern: the vital need of people to be aware of their interdependence, not only with each other, but with the world and its environment.<br /><br />My older son was a fighter pilot in the United States Air Force. His death in the cockpit of a warplane tore away a piece of my world. But it left me, too, with a wish to honor him by joining the many others trying to find a way to end conflict on this very fragile earth.<br />I am a grandmother now. For my own grandchildren - and for all those of their generation - I try, through writing, to convey my passionate awareness that we live intertwined on this planet and that our future depends upon our caring more, and doing more, for one another.""","Lois Lowry","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2493.Lois_Lowry","Paperback","3636","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KV1QTDK/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385732554/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385732554&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Giver&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780385732550","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D0385732554","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780385732550","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780385732550?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780385732550&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D0385732554","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780385732550","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FThe+Giver-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D0385732554","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385732550","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:0385732554/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=0385732554","At the age of twelve, Jonas, a young boy from a seemingly utopian, futuristic world, is singled out to receive special training from The Giver, who alone holds the memories of the true joys and pain of life.","April 26, 1993","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1342493368i/3636.jpg","208","2345519","76635","Ember","January 24, 2006","4.12","The Giver","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3636.The_Giver"
"Chief Bromden, Randle Patrick McMurphy, Nurse Ratched, William ""Billy"" Bibbit, Charles Cheswick, Dale Harding, Doctor Spivey, Bruce Fredrickson, James ""Jim"" Sefelt, Scanlon, Martini","English",,,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest",,"Ken Kesey was American writer, who gained world fame with his novel <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i> (1962, filmed 1975). In the 1960s, Kesey became a counterculture hero and a guru of psychedelic drugs with Timothy Leary. Kesey has been called the Pied Piper, who changed the beat generation into the hippie movement.<br /><br />Ken Kesey was born in La Junta, CO, and brought up in Eugene, OR. He spent his early years hunting, fishing, swimming; he learned to box and wrestle, and he was a star football player. He studied at the University of Oregon, where he acted in college plays. On graduating he won a scholarship to Stanford University. Kesey soon dropped out, joined the counterculture movement, and began experimenting with drugs. In 1956 he married his school sweetheart, Faye Haxby.<br /><br />Kesey attended a creative writing course taught by the novelist Wallace Stegner. His first work was an unpublished novel, <i>ZOO</i>, about the beatniks of the North Beach community in San Francisco. Tom Wolfe described in his book <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i> (1968) Kesey and his friends, called the Merry Pranksters, as they traveled the country and used various hallucinogens. Their bus, called Furthur, was painted in Day-Glo colors. In California Kesey's friends served LSD-laced Kool-Aid to members of their parties.<br /><br />At a Veterans' Administration hospital in Menlo Park, California, Kesey was paid as a volunteer experimental subject, taking mind-altering drugs and reporting their effects. These experiences as a part-time aide at a psychiatric hospital, LSD sessions - and a vision of an Indian sweeping there the floor - formed the background for <i>One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest</i>, set in a mental hospital. While writing the work, and continuing in the footsteps of such writers as Thomas De Quincy (<i>Confessions of an English Opium Eater</i>, 1821), Aldous Huxley (<i>The Doors of Perception</i>, 1954), and William S. Burroughs (<i>Naked Lunch</i>, 1959), Kesey took peyote. The story is narrated by Chief Bromden. Into his world enters the petty criminal and prankster Randall Patrick McMurphy with his efforts to change the bureaucratic system of the institution, ruled by Nurse Ratched. <br /><br />The film adaptation of the book gained a huge success. When the film won five Academy Awards, Kesey was barely mentioned during the award ceremonies, and he made known his unhappiness with the film. He did not like Jack Nicholson, or the script, and sued the producers.<br /><br />Kesey's next novel, <i>Sometimes a Great Notion</i> (1964), appeared two years later and was also made into a film, this time directed by Paul Newman. The story was set in a logging community and centered on two brothers and their bitter rivalry in the family. After the work, Kesey gave up publishing novels. He formed a band of ""Merry Pranksters"", set up a commune in La Honda, California, bought an old school bus, and toured America and Mexico with his friends, among them Neal Cassady, Kerouac's travel companion. Dressed in a jester's outfit, Kesey was the chief prankster.<br /><br />In 1965 Kesey was arrested for possession of marijuana. He fled to Mexico, where he faked an unconvincing suicide and then returned to the United States, serving a five-month prison sentence at the San Mateo County Jail. After this tumultuous period he bought farm in Pleasant Hill, Oregon, settled down with his wife to raise their four children, and taught a graduate writing seminar at the University of Oregon. In the early 1970s Kesey returned to writing and published <i>Kesey's Garage Sale</i> (1973). His later works include the children's book <i>Little Tricker the Squirrel Meets Big Double the Bear</i>(1990) and <i>Sailor Song</i> (1992), a futuristic tale about an Alaskan fishing village and Hollywood film crew. <i>Last Go Around</i> (1994), Kesey's last book, was an account of a famous Oregon rodeo written in the form of pulp fiction. In 2001, Kesey died of complications after surgery for liver cance","Ken Kesey","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7285.Ken_Kesey","Mass Market Paperback","332613","http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&creative=374001&campaign=211041&adid=082VK13VJJCZTQYGWWCZ&index=books&keyword=One+Flew+Over+the+Cuckoo%27s+Nest","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=One+Flew+Over+the+Cuckoo%27s+Nest&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/One+Flew+Over+the+Cuckoo%27s+Nest","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Ftn%3DOne+Flew+Over+the+Cuckoo%27s+Nest","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3DOne+Flew+Over+the+Cuckoo%27s+Nest","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=One+Flew+Over+the+Cuckoo%27s+Nest&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3DOne+Flew+Over+the+Cuckoo%27s+Nest","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=One+Flew+Over+the+Cuckoo%27s+Nest","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FOne+Flew+Over+the+Cuckoo%27s+Nest-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3DOne+Flew+Over+the+Cuckoo%27s+Nest","https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=One+Flew+Over+the+Cuckoo%27s+Nest","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:One+Flew+Over+the+Cuckoo%27s+Nest/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=One+Flew+Over+the+Cuckoo%27s+Nest",,,"Alternate cover edition of ISBN <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58461500-one-flew-over-the-cuckoo-s-nest"">9780451163967</a><br /><br />Tyrannical Nurse Ratched rules her ward in an Oregon State mental hospital with a strict and unbending routine, unopposed by her patients, who remain cowed by mind-numbing medication and the threat of electric shock therapy. But her regime is disrupted by the arrival of McMurphy – the swaggering, fun-loving trickster with a devilish grin who resolves to oppose her rules on behalf of his fellow inmates. His struggle is seen through the eyes of Chief Bromden, a seemingly mute half-Indian patient who understands McMurphy's heroic attempt to do battle with the powers that keep them imprisoned. Ken Kesey's extraordinary first novel is an exuberant, ribald and devastatingly honest portrayal of the boundaries between sanity and madness.","January 1, 1962","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1516211014i/332613.jpg","325","715363","15035","Signet","February 1, 1963","4.2","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/332613.One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoo_s_Nest"
"Nero (emperor), Caligula, Livia Drusa, Agrippina the Elder, Valeria Messalina, Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, Augustus","English","067972477X","James Tait Black Memorial Prize, Hawthornden Prize, Audie Award","I, Claudius","Claudius","<b>Robert von Ranke Graves</b> (1895-1985), born in Wimbledon, received his early education at King's College School and Copthorne Prep School, Wimbledon &amp; Charterhouse School and won a scholarship to St John's College, Oxford. While at Charterhouse in 1912, he fell in love with G.H. Johnstone, a boy of fourteen (""Dick"" in <i>Goodbye to All That</i>) When challenged by the headmaster he defended himself by citing Plato, Greek poets, Michelangelo &amp; Shakespeare, ""who had felt as I did"".<br /><br />At the outbreak of WWI, Graves enlisted almost immediately, taking a commission in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. He published his first volume of poems, <i>Over the Brazier</i>, in 1916. He developed an early reputation as a war poet and was one of the first to write realistic poems about his experience of front line conflict. In later years he omitted war poems from his collections, on the grounds that they were too obviously ""part of the war poetry boom"". At the Battle of the Somme he was so badly wounded by a shell-fragment through the lung that he was expected to die, and indeed was officially reported as 'died of wounds'. He gradually recovered. Apart from a brief spell back in France, he spent the rest of the war in England.<br /><br />One of Graves's closest friends at this time was the poet Siegfried Sassoon, who was also an officer in the RWF. In 1917 Sassoon tried to rebel against the war by making a public anti-war statement. Graves, who feared Sassoon could face a court martial, intervened with the military authorities and persuaded them that he was suffering from shell shock, and to treat him accordingly. Graves also suffered from shell shock, or neurasthenia as it is sometimes called, although he was never hospitalised for it.<br /><br />Biographers document the story well. It is fictionalised in Pat Barker's novel <i>Regeneration</i>. The intensity of their early relationship is nowhere demonstrated more clearly than in Graves's collection <i>Fairies &amp; Fusiliers</i> (1917), which contains a plethora of poems celebrating their friendship. Through Sassoon, he also became friends with Wilfred Owen, whose talent he recognised. Owen attended Graves's wedding to Nancy Nicholson in 1918, presenting him with, as Graves recalled, ""a set of 12 Apostle spoons"".<br /><br />Following his marriage and the end of the war, Graves belatedly took up his place at St John's College, Oxford. He later attempted to make a living by running a small shop, but the business failed. In 1926 he took up a post at Cairo University, accompanied by his wife, their children and the poet Laura Riding. He returned to London briefly, where he split with his wife under highly emotional circumstances before leaving to live with Riding in Deià, Majorca. There they continued to publish letterpress books under the rubric of the Seizin Press, founded and edited the literary journal <i>Epilogue</i>, and wrote two successful academic books together: <i>A Survey of Modernist Poetry</i> (1927) and <i>A Pamphlet Against Anthologies</i> (1928).<br /><br />In 1927, he published <i>Lawrence and the Arabs</i>, a commercially successful biography of T.E. Lawrence. <i>Good-bye to All That</i> (1929, revised and republished in 1957) proved a success but cost him many of his friends, notably Sassoon. In 1934 he published his most commercially successful work,<i> I, Claudius</i>. Using classical sources he constructed a complexly compelling tale of the life of the Roman emperor Claudius, a tale extended in <i>Claudius the God</i> (1935). Another historical novel by Graves, <i>Count Belisarius</i> (1938), recounts the career of the Byzantine general Belisarius.<br /><br />During the early 1970s Graves began to suffer from increasingly severe memory loss, and by his eightieth birthday in 1975 he had come to the end of his working life. By 1975 he had published more than 140 works. He survived for ten more years in an increasingly dependent condition until he died from heart failure.","Robert Graves","https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3012988.Robert_Graves","Paperback","18765","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NMNS2NY/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067972477X/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=067972477X&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2","https://www.amazon.com/s?k=I%2C+Claudius&i=audible&ref=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20&tag=x_gr_w_bb_audible-20","https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=9780679724773","http://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/64613/77416/2029?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn%3D067972477X","https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=361251.1&type=10&tmpid=9309&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%3FQuery%3D9780679724773","https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9780679724773?at=11lvdC&mt=11&ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9780679724773&c=books&PCamrefID=bookpage&PAffiliateID=10lHMS","http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GwEz7vxblVU&subid=&offerid=189673.1&type=10&tmpid=939&&u1=x_gr_w_bb&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2Fbooksearch%3Fkeyword%3D067972477X","https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/home/search/?keywords=9780679724773","http://www.tkqlhce.com/ob117vpyvpxCFFFKMHLCEDHLGHKECEFMIGDFFHJDDD?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterworldbooks.com%2FI%2C+Claudius-H0.aspx%3FSearchTerm%3D067972477X","https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780679724773","https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101ljNE7/pubref:067972477X/destination:https://www.thriftbooks.com/browse/?b.search=067972477X","Into the 'autobiography' of Clau-Clau-Claudius, the pitiful stammerer who was destined to become Emperor in spite of himself, Graves packs the everlasting intrigues, the depravity, the bloody purges and mounting cruelty of the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, soon to culminate in the deified insanity of Caligula.<br /><br /><i>I, Claudius</i> and its sequel, <i>Claudius the God</i>, are among the most celebrated, as well the most gripping historical novels ever written.<br /><br />Cover illustration: Brian Pike","January 1, 1934","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1657550972i/18765.jpg","468","64795","3290","Vintage","October 23, 1989","4.24","I, Claudius","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18765.I_Claudius"

He recalled the English suburban culture of the 1930s as oppressively conformist and his family life as intensely conventional. Of his childhood, Fowles said ""I have tried to escape ever since.""<br /><br />Fowles attended Bedford School, a large boarding school designed to prepare boys for university, from ages 13 to 18. After briefly attending the University of Edinburgh, Fowles began compulsory military service in 1945 with training at Dartmoor, where he spent the next two years. World War II ended shortly after his training began so Fowles never came near combat, and by 1947 he had decided that the military life was not for him.<br /><br />Fowles then spent four years at Oxford, where he discovered the writings of the French existentialists. In particular he admired Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, whose writings corresponded with his own ideas about conformity and the will of the individual. He received a degree in French in 1950 and began to consider a career as a writer.<br /><br />Several teaching jobs followed: a year lecturing in English literature at the University of Poitiers, France; two years teaching English at Anargyrios College on the Greek island of Spetsai; and finally, between 1954 and 1963, teaching English at St. Godric's College in London, where he ultimately served as the department head.<br /><br />The time spent in Greece was of great importance to Fowles. During his tenure on the island he began to write poetry and to overcome a long-time repression about writing. Between 1952 and 1960 he wrote several novels but offered none to a publisher, considering them all incomplete in some way and too lengthy.<br /><br />In late 1960 Fowles completed the first draft of <i>The Collector</i> in just four weeks. He continued to revise it until the summer of 1962, when he submitted it to a publisher; it appeared in the spring of 1963 and was an immediate best-seller. The critical acclaim and commercial success of the book allowed Fowles to devote all of his time to writing.<br /><br /><i>The Aristos</i>, a collection of philosophical thoughts and musings on art, human nature and other subjects, appeared the following year. Then in 1965, <i>The Magus</i> - drafts of which Fowles had been working on for over a decade - was published. <br /><br />The most commercially successful of Fowles' novels, <i>The French Lieutenant's Woman,</i> appeared in 1969. It resembles a Victorian novel in structure and detail, while pushing the traditional boundaries of narrative in a very modern manner. <br /><br />In the 1970s Fowles worked on a variety of literary projects--including a series of essays on nature--and in 1973 he published a collection of poetry, <i>Poems</i>. <br /><br /><i>Daniel Martin</i>, a long and somewhat autobiographical novel spanning over 40 years in the life of a screenwriter, appeared in 1977, along with a revised version of <i>The Magus</i>. These were followed by <i>Mantissa</i> (1982), a fable about a novelist's struggle with his muse; and <i>A Maggot</i> (1985), an 18th century mystery which combines science fiction and history.<br /><br />In addition to <i>The Aristos</i>, Fowles wrote a variety of non-fiction pieces including many essays, reviews, and forewords/afterwords to other writers' novels.

In this searing courtroom drama, best-selling author John Grisham probes the savage depths of racial violence, as he delivers a compelling tale of uncertain justice in a small southern town, Clanton, Mississippi. <br /><br />The life of a ten-year-old girl is shattered by two drunken and remorseless young men. The mostly white town reacts with shock and horror at the inhuman crime. That is, until her black father acquires an assault rifle and takes matters into his hands. <br /><br />For ten days, as burning crosses and the crack of sniper fire spread through the streets of Clanton, the nation sits spellbound as young defense attorney Jake Brigance struggles to save his client's life, and then his own.","January 1, 1989","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1554303029i/32542.jpg","738","789841","6758","Dell","March 15, 2004","4.11","A Time to Kill","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32542.A_Time_to_Kill"
